<p class="customisedFont">In <strong>Italy</strong> polls opened in a general election to fill seats in both houses of the country’s parliament, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The vote is expected to return a victory for a right-wing coalition led by the far-right <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-brothers-of-italy-look-set-to-win-the-next-election">Brothers of Italy</a> party. The party’s leader, Giorgia Meloni, is thus likely to become the country’s first female prime minister.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Russia launched new strikes on Ukrainian cities while residents in four Russian-controlled parts of <strong>Ukraine</strong> were coerced into <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/23/voting-begins-in-four-sham-referendums-in-ukraine">voting</a> in favour of joining <strong>Russia</strong>. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, promised “full protection” for any Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia. Meanwhile more than 700 people were arrested on Saturday for participating in protests against Russia’s “<strong>partial mobilisation</strong>”, according to OVD-Info, a human-rights group. President Vladimir Putin also dismissed the general in charge of logistics, an apparent punishment for the woeful progress of the invasion.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea</strong> fired a short-range ballistic missile off its east coast, according to South Korea’s army. The launch—the latest in a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/02/03/what-is-behind-north-koreas-flurry-of-missile-tests">flurry of missile tests </a>this year—came just after an American aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea to participate in military drills. South Korea called it an “act of grave provocation”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Eliud Kipchoge, a Kenyan runner, broke his own world record for the <strong>fastest marathon</strong>. He finished the 26.2-mile (42.2km) race in Berlin in two hours, one minute and nine seconds, some 30 seconds faster than his previous best. Mr Kipchoge has run the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/game-theory/2019/04/05/the-marathon-has-vanquished-other-long-distance-running-events">distance</a> in less than two hours before, in 2019, but as it did not take place in an official competition the time was not a world record.</p>

<p class="customisedFont">Authorities in <strong>the Philippines</strong> began evacuating people from coastal areas as a major typhoon approached. Forecasters said Typhoon Noru is heading towards Luzon, the archipelago’s main island, at speeds of 120mph. In Canada, <strong>Storm Fiona</strong> made landfall on the country’s east coast, destroying several homes and power lines. And in the Caribbean tropical storm Ian is forecast on Sunday to strengthen to become a hurricane.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Banks in Lebanon will reopen on Monday, after armed raids by customers demanding access to their savings forced branches to close.

<h3>Scholz of Arabia</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, is visiting three Gulf states this weekend in a bid to shore up energy supplies and dampen prices. With imports of oil and gas from Russia cut off, and power-hungry firms and households facing steep winter bills, Europe’s biggest economy is sliding towards a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/31/europe-is-heading-for-recession-how-bad-will-it-be">recession</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Scholz will turn on the charm in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, all big energy exporters, arguing that it is in their own long-term interest to calm markets and keep customers happy. Germany is particularly keen to secure liquefied natural gas deliveries from Qatar, which vies with America and Australia as the top exporter of the fuel. But the toughest meeting on Mr Scholz’s first visit to the region as chancellor may be with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/07/28/mbs-despot-in-the-desert">Muhammad bin Salman</a>, the Saudi crown prince. The kingdom’s record on human rights and its messy entanglement in Yemen’s civil war have not endeared the Saudi leader to German public opinion. </p>
<h3>Political protests in Angola</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When supporters of Angola’s main opposition party take to the streets on Saturday they will know that their cause is just—and their chances of success slim. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) says <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/08/an-unofficial-tally-exposes-angolas-dodgy-election">last month’s election</a> was rigged by the ruling party—and its former enemy in the country’s civil war—the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). </p>
<p class="customisedFont">UNITA has a case. Tallies collected by NGOs suggest the result was a near-tie. Yet the electoral commission announced that the MPLA won 51% of the vote. Without a majority, the party’s grip on power would have been at risk. Alas, the courts, the commission and, most importantly, Angola’s security apparatus, are all under its thumb. So UNITA’s protests will probably be defeated, peacefully or otherwise. The only comfort it can take is that, given President João Lourenço’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/18/a-dictators-ghost-haunts-angolas-upcoming-elections">disappointing record</a>, the opposition will only grow in strength in Africa’s largest oil producer. </p>
<h3>“Sidney”, a new look at a Hollywood trailblazer</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The rags-to-riches life story of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/it-was-hard-for-any-viewer-to-look-away-from-sidney-poitier/21807122">Sidney Poitier</a>, as recounted in a new documentary about the trailblazing actor, just released, is as compelling a narrative as any in his films. Sir Sidney’s parents were poor Bahamian tomato farmers. As a teenager, he was taught to read by a Jewish waiter in New York. He went on to become one of Hollywood’s first black leading men (starring in hits like “The Defiant Ones” and “Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner”), the first black winner of an Academy Award for acting (for “Lilies of the Field”), and a director of raucous comedies (such as “Stir Crazy”).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Oprah Winfrey, the documentary’s producer, and other friends speak of him with love and respect. But the highlights of “Sidney” are the archive interviews with the actor himself, who died in January at the age of 94. The towering dignity and authority that made him a superstar can be seen in every clip.</p>
<h3>Juanes, a Colombian rock star, plays in America</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Juanes returns to the American stage in San Diego on Saturday to promote his album, “Origen”. The Colombian singer, a winner of three Grammy awards and 26 Latin Grammys, will also release a new album in the coming months.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">His songs unite traditional Colombian rhythms with rock instrumentation, giving him rockstar status in his homeland. Born in 1972 and growing up in 1980s Medellín, a city terrorised by Pablo Escobar’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/02/08/how-drug-trafficking-is-and-isnt-to-blame-for-violence-in-latin-america">drug cartel</a> and guerrilla fighters, music provided an emotional escape: “We clung to it as if our lives depended on it,” he recalled. His breakthrough hit was “Fijate Bien”, a song about Colombia’s ubiquitous land mines. In 2008 his “Peace Without Borders” concerts attempted to create cross-border civilian unity amid the diplomatic crisis unfolding between Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. His career spans a turbulent period of Colombian history—but also a time of change. Last month Colombia’s first ever <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/06/20/how-gustavo-petro-a-former-guerrilla-might-govern-colombia">left-wing president</a> took office.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: William Kentridge, South African artist</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Using just a stick of charcoal and crisp sheet of white paper, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2020/12/09/william-kentridge-contemplates-history-and-creation">William Kentridge</a> tries to make sense of a messy world. Over and over, he traces a line, smudges it a little, rubs it out and traces it anew. His mediums are many, his subjects wide ranging: the Russian revolution; the great colonial wars of the 20th century; the inequities of his native South Africa, first under apartheid and then democratic rule. Doubt, migration and the slipperiness of history are recurring themes.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Aged 67, Mr Kentridge is in the flush of his career—and having a moment. This month “Self-Portrait as a Coffee Pot”, a documentary series chronicling his studio practice, had its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. In London he is involved in three shows. A retrospective at the Royal Academy of Arts, opening on Saturday, is packed to the gunwales with his drawings, sculptures and sets for theatre and opera. Starting on October 6th the Barbican will stage performances, involving music and dance, by South African artists developed at Mr Kentridge’s incubator in Johannesburg. Also next month Goodman Gallery will screen “Oh to Believe in Another World”, a stop-motion film set to Dmitri Shostakovich’s Tenth Symphony.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Shostakovich composed the symphony around the time of Joseph Stalin’s death; its explosive second movement is said to evoke state terror. Mr Kentridge uses marionettes to explore the composer’s attitudes towards Stalin and the Soviet Union. The film resembles a collage. Like much of Mr Kentridge’s work, it implies that history itself is a process of eliding, distorting and stitching things back together.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For the impatient viewer these works may be noisy and confusing. But it’s worth persisting. “One of the hard things to realise”, says Mr Kentridge, “is the edge of who one is, of what your imagination can produce.”</p>
