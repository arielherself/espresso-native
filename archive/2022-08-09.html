<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Donald Trump</strong> said FBI agents had raided his Mar-a-Lago home and prised open a safe. The raid is reportedly connected to a complaint the National Archives raised earlier this year: that 15 boxes of documents from Mr Trump’s time as president, including classified material, were removed to his estate in Florida. The FBI’s action ramps up the legal pressure on Mr Trump, who is being investigated on several fronts, not least for his part in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity">insurrection at Capitol Hill</a> on January 6th 2021. Mr Trump blamed “Radical Left Democrats” trying to thwart his next presidential run.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia</strong> said it would suspend American inspections of its <strong>nuclear weapons</strong> under the New START treaty, and blamed Western sanctions for making the process too difficult. The treaty is the only remaining <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/31/will-the-ukraine-war-ring-the-knell-for-nuclear-arms-control">nuclear-arms agreement</a> between America and Russia. It limits the number of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="http://west-and-russia-to-nuclear-war">weapons</a> they can deploy, and allows each country to inspect the other’s arsenal. The treaty expires in 2026, though President Joe Biden wants to negotiate a replacement.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukrainian</strong> staff at the <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack">nuclear power plant</a> are “working under the barrels of Russian guns”, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN’s nuclear watchdog said on Monday. He called for an international mission to the facility, which was reportedly damaged by Russian shelling over the weekend. Meanwhile Ukrainian troops claimed to have retaken the Russian-occupied town of Dovhenke, south of Kharkiv, and were advancing on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/russia-begins-a-new-phase-of-its-war-in-ukraine/21808840">Izyum</a>, a strategic transport hub in the Donbas region.</p>

On Tuesday Taiwan conducted its own defensive drills.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Seoul </strong>was battered by the worst <strong>storm </strong>to pass through South Korea’s capital in 80 years. At some points, nearly four inches of rain were falling per hour, submerging streetside vehicles, roads and subway lines, and knocking out much of the city’s electricity supply. At least eight citizens died in the chaos.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s Federal Aviation Administration said <strong>Boeing</strong> could soon resume shipments of its 787 Dreamliner jets, nearly two years after deliveries were first halted because of manufacturing flaws.

<h3>Will crime hit Ilhan Omar in Minneapolis?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Four states are holding primary elections on Tuesday, ahead of the mid-terms in November. But it is perhaps Minnesota—specifically its fifth congressional district, which includes its biggest city, Minneapolis—which offers the greatest chance for a surprise. That is because of voters worried about crime.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Since the summer of 2020, when George Floyd was murdered by a city police officer, policing has remained a burning issue. But attitudes have changed as crime—particularly shootings and carjacking—has soared nationwide.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ilhan Omar, a hyper-progressive Democratic congresswoman (and a founding member of “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2020/05/21/donald-trumps-favourite-freshmen-face-primaries">the squad</a>”), may be on the losing side of the shift in attitudes. She has been an enthusiastic proponent of defunding the police, proposing to abolish Minneapolis’s police department. In November voters soundly rejected that idea. And Tuesday’s primary gives them a chance to replace Ms Omar with Don Samuels, a former city-council member who has campaigned heavily on the issue of crime. Ms Omar is still the favourite to win—but an upset is not out of the question.</p>
<h3>A new president for Kenya</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Kenya has been a multi-party democracy for 30 years. Its record of success as such is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/07/why-kenyas-election-matters">patchy</a>. Elections in 2002 were a joyful affair, but a disputed vote in 2007 was followed by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2007/12/30/kenyas-unsound-election">ethnic violence</a>. Kenyans trudging to elect their fifth president on Tuesday have a weariness in their step. That has much to do with the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/07/kenyas-presidential-election-looks-too-close-to-call">unprepossessing candidates</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Raila Odinga, just about the front-runner, came second in the previous three presidential elections he contested. But his alliance with the unpopular outgoing president, Uhuru Kenyatta, tarnished his reputation—and Mr Kenyatta has struggled to persuade his tribe, the Kikuyu, to support Mr Odinga. His main rival is William Ruto, the current deputy president. Jilted by Mr Kenyatta, Mr Ruto and his populist campaign have tapped into Kenyans’ discontent.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Extravagant election promises, such as universal health care, will be difficult to fund and so have met indifference. Many young Kenyans have not even bothered to register to vote. The victor will have to deal with a sullen electorate and a struggling economy. Perhaps Kenya has reached political maturity after all.</p>
<h3>Inflation in emerging markets</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Brazil and China are at opposite ends of the famous BRICs acronym, first coined by Goldman Sachs, a bank, to refer to four of the biggest emerging markets. The two giants are also at opposite ends of the global <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/03/does-high-inflation-matter">inflation cycle</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Brazil’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/07/are-central-banks-in-emerging-markets-now-less-of-a-slave-to-the-fed">central bank</a> was one of the first to react to the danger of rising prices. It began raising interest rates in March 2021 and has battled inflation furiously since. In June the country’s annual inflation rate reached 11.9%. New inflation figures on Tuesday could show signs that price growth is finally peaking.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In China, which is suffering a prolonged property slump and intermittent virus-fighting lockdowns, economic overheating has seemed a distant worry. But new figures on Wednesday could show long dormant inflation beginning to stir, finally threatening the government’s 3% target. When it comes to inflation, these two emerging—yet diverging—economies could finish the year a little closer to each other.</p>
<h3>The people choosing Britain’s next prime minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">What is a Tory? Once the question was answered with comic references to pink faces and pinker trousers. The humour has faded. In the past four years, Conservative Party members have twice chosen Britain’s prime minister. After <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/07/07/britain-after-boris">Boris Johnson announced his resignation</a> in July, they are being called upon once again. On Tuesday they will gather in Darlington in north-east England, the latest stop on a tour by Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, the candidates seeking to woo them. By the end of the week members will have received their postal ballots, due back by September 2nd.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">No one knows exactly how many <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/05/the-people-about-to-choose-britains-next-prime-minister">Tory party members</a> there are; it is thought to be around 160,000. They are overwhelmingly <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/26/britains-tories-are-overwhelmingly-male-pale-and-stale">male, old and white</a>. At hustings they are polite, if prone to the odd harrumph. Some are attracted by the “bonkers” nature of Ms Truss, the foreign secretary and favourite to beat Mr Sunak, the former chancellor. And many do, in fact, wear pink trousers.</p>
<h3>Philip Larkin at 100</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">By the time the poet <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/07/28/philip-larkins-verse-is-tender-his-prejudices-are-controversial">Philip Larkin</a> died in 1985, his best lines enjoyed wide currency in modern Britain. An elegant and accessible craftsman, bleakly humorous and free of illusions, he seemed perfectly attuned to the details of suburban melancholy. But when his letters were published in 1992, they exposed seams of misogyny, racism and puerility. His reputation wobbled, yet recovered: in 2008 the <em>Times</em>, a British newspaper, hailed him as the greatest British writer since 1945.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">As admirers mark the centenary of Larkin’s birth on Tuesday, his faults are again under the microscope. This time they are magnified by academics eager to reshape the literary canon. Traditional types complain that any move to cut him from school poetry anthologies is vandalism. Even his most ardent fans admit that his interests are narrow. But his rueful <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2012/01/21/library-book">reflections</a> on boredom and romantic disappointment still prove consoling for some. Despite the controversy, he remains the unofficial laureate of humdrum Englishness.</p>
