<p class="customisedFont">Shots were fired between unknown groups in <strong>Turkey’s </strong>Hatay province, disrupting efforts to rescue survivors from devastating earthquakes that struck six days ago. There were also reports that 50 people were arrested for looting in the area. The death toll in Turkey and neighbouring <strong>Syria</strong> has now passed 28,000. Ever fewer survivors are being pulled from the rubble.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">An American fighter jet, acting at <strong>Canada’s</strong> behest, shot down an unidentified <strong>flying object </strong>over Canadian airspace. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadian forces would “recover and analyse the wreckage”. It came days after the downing of another unidentified object over Alaska and of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/02/07/the-lessons-from-the-chinese-spy-balloon">Chinese spy balloon</a> off the coast of South Carolina.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, told the BBC that sending <strong>fighter jets</strong> to <strong>Ukraine </strong>would have to be a “joint decision” with other NATO members and would “not be easy to take”. Ukraine’s Western allies—including Poland, one of the most hawkish—remain leery of sending <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/02/01/why-does-ukraine-want-western-jets-and-will-it-get-them">American F-15 or F-16 </a>aircraft, despite the entreaties made by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in London, Paris and Brussels this week.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Iran’s</strong> president, Ebrahim Raisi, declared that months-long <strong>protests </strong>against his regime had <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/12/protests-have-subsided-in-iran-but-clerics-cannot-yet-proclaim-victory">been defeated</a>. The country was roiled by demonstrations following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old who was beaten by police. Speaking at a rally to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Mr Raisi claimed the protests had been fuelled by Western “conspiracies”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Marc Tarabella, a Belgian MEP, was charged with <strong>corruption</strong> and other crimes over his alleged role in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/15/a-corruption-scandal-leaves-the-eu-reeling">money-for-influence scheme</a> at the <strong>European Parliament</strong> that is said to involve Qatar. Another MEP who is co-operating with prosecutors had alleged that Mr Tarabella received up to €140,000 ($150,000) in bribes. Five other people have been charged with the same offences so far.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of <strong>France</strong> for a fourth national protest against plans to raise the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/01/31/why-is-the-french-pension-age-so-low">pension age</a> from 62 to 64. In January, more than 1m workers took part in strikes. Even though the French spend longer in retirement on average than people in almost any other country in the OECD, most oppose President Emmanuel Macron’s plans.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>Canadian women’s football </strong>team vowed to boycott training and matches over a dispute about funding and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2019/06/27/where-female-athletes-are-more-popular-than-male-ones">pay equity</a> with the country’s national football organisation. They contend that budget cuts are kneecapping them months before the Women’s World Cup. In 2021 Canada Soccer spent C$11m ($8.2m) on the men’s team and C$5.1m on the women’s, which won Olympic gold that year.</p>

<h3>A tense anniversary for Iran’s Islamic Republic</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday Iranians mark 44 years since the country overthrew its secular monarchy. It has been an unnerving few months for the theocratic regime that replaced it: protests over the death of<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/09/28/im-the-same-as-mahsa-and-i-want-my-freedom-anger-at-irans-regime-spills-onto-the-streets"> Mahsa Amini</a>, a young woman arrested for wearing her headscarf “improperly”, posed the biggest threat to its authority in years. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">By locking up nearly 20,000 people and sentencing dozens to death the clerics have<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/12/protests-have-subsided-in-iran-but-clerics-cannot-yet-proclaim-victory"> dampened dissent</a>. University campuses, which were hubs of protest, became heavily policed. As part of an annual pardoning, the regime has reportedly offered amnesty or reduced prison sentences for “tens of thousands” (though the terms would seem to exclude most political prisoners).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Iran’s economy, however, is a mess. Inflation has soared. The government subsidises petrol, meaning a litre last month cost the equivalent of five American cents, but this is unsustainable. When prices inevitably go up Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, may face renewed resistance.</p>
<h3>Starlink’s indispensable role in Ukraine</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukrainian troops have used the Starlink satellite-internet service <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2023/01/05/how-elon-musks-satellites-have-saved-ukraine-and-changed-warfare">for everything</a> from artillery spotting and command-and-control to flying military drones. But earlier this week Gwynne Shotwell, the president of SpaceX, which provides the portable antennas, announced that the firm is restricting military uses of its technology. Ms Shotwell said that the technology “was never intended to be weaponised”, and that SpaceX had taken steps to prevent Ukraine from using it to control drones. Her comments puzzled critics: in December SpaceX revealed the existence of “Starshield”, a version of Starlink aimed squarely at governmental and military customers. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">This development has worsened already strained relations between Ukraine and the tech firm. SpaceX has reportedly prevented its service from working in Crimea, where Ukraine has conducted numerous raids. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian government adviser, said the company should choose which side it is on. But besides such displays of public displeasure, Ukraine has few other options. For now, no other satellite-internet firm can match Starlink’s scale.</p>
<h3>Donatello, a father of the Renaissance</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Michelangelo’s chiselled, five-metre-high David, carved in the early 1500s, may be the world’s most recognisable sculpture. Yet that work owes a debt to another Italian master, Donato di Niccolo di Betto Bardi, better known as Donatello. His bronze David—lithe, enigmatic and less than two metres tall—was the first free-standing nude statue since antiquity, predating Michelangelo’s by about 60 years. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday a breathtaking exhibition of Donatello’s statues, busts and carvings opens at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among its delights are his shallow bas-reliefs, noteworthy for their one-point perspective and illusions of depth. His figures, meanwhile, are delicately rendered and anatomically precise. Little wonder he is called a father of the Renaissance, cited as an influence on Michelangelo, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2020/05/31/raphaels-genius-and-the-future-of-museums-on-display-in-rome">Raphael</a> and other successors. Few museums outside Italy own Donatello’s work, making the show a rare treat.</p>
<h3>Male stripping and entrepreneurship</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Early in many films, in what is known as the “inciting incident”, a character must make a momentous choice. Their decision puts the plot in motion. In “Magic Mike’s Last Dance”, released in America and Britain on Friday, the protagonist’s dilemma is simple: do I gyrate for this rich woman in my underwear or not?</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mike (Channing Tatum) obliges, and is whisked off to London by his client to set up an all-male strip show. The characters insist that it is a noble and ancient art form—although all that thrusting and grinding will make one’s testicles “chafed as shit”, Mike warns his new recruits.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The film is a meta-commentary on itself. The first two “Magic Mike” films so titillated viewers—the first one made $167m from a $7m budget—that Mr Tatum decided to turn the premise into a live show. Launched in 2017, it is still being performed in Las Vegas and London. Sex, it seems, still sells.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Gustavo Dudamel, star maestro</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Gustavo Dudamel is easily excited—unusually so in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/17/the-classical-music-world-is-grappling-with-accessibility">serious world</a> of classical music. “Everything was too loud and everything was too fast, and I loved it,” remembered Sir Simon Rattle, an illustrious conductor, of his introduction to Mr Dudamel, then a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2013/12/23/gustavo-dudamels-next-mountain">young prodigy</a>. Now aged 42, Mr Dudamel has mastered the tempo without sacrificing the passion. On Tuesday it was announced that he will jump from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which he has led since 2009, to the New York Philharmonic in 2026. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Born in Venezuela, Mr Dudamel got his start in the country’s famous free music education programme, El Sistema, playing the violin. When his own conductor was late to rehearsal one day, he picked up the baton and gave it a whirl. His conductor invited him to be his assistant; Mr Dudamel was about 12. He soon began directing a Venezuelan orchestra and won an international conducting competition in Germany at the age of 23. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Today the curly-haired Mr Dudamel is one of the world’s most recognisable maestros. He has brought verve to the Los Angeles Philharmonic; the Paris Opera, where he is music director; and the animated film “Trolls 2: World Tour” (for which he voiced the character of a conductor). He has led Venezuela’s Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra in a rousing version of “Mambo”, from Leonard Bernstein’s “West Side Story”, a number of times. One performance has 1.7m views on YouTube. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Dudamel’s appointment in New York should restore some cachet to the ensemble, which, in its glory days in the mid-20th century, was led by Bernstein. Today it faces a challenging financial future: elderly concertgoers have been reluctant to return even as the pandemic subsides. Mr Dudamel’s spirited conducting and renown promise to attract crowds and wealthy donors.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In Los Angeles, he always made a point of bowing to the cheap seats behind the orchestra. He encourages clapping between sets and rejects stilted dress codes. It is the music, not its trappings, that so excites him.</p>
