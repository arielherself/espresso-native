<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, a former chancellor, will become Britain’s new prime minister after winning the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-reads/2022/07/12/what-to-read-to-understand-the-conservative-party" data-tegid="5pv2lg9tickti20mdd133h4jhu88pttj"><strong>Conservative Party</strong></a> leadership race to replace Liz Truss. His only competitor, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/15/who-is-penny-mordaunt">Penny Mordaunt</a>, leader of the House of Commons, withdrew from the contest at the last minute after she failed to gather sufficient backing from fellow MPs; she said Mr Sunak had her “full support”. As Britain’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/07/07/boris-johnson-should-go-immediately">third prime minister</a> in seven weeks, Mr Sunak will also be the country’s first non-white leader.</p>

The Hang Seng China Enterprises index in Hong Kong fell by more than 7%. Earlier China belatedly released third-quarter economic data, showing that GDP grew by 3.9% over the past 12 months, well below the CCP’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/20/chinas-rulers-seem-resigned-to-a-slowing-economy">growth target</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Russian claims that <strong>Ukraine</strong> was planning to detonate a “<strong>dirty bomb</strong>”, saying they may be cover for the Kremlin to deploy such a weapon itself. The White House also pooh-poohed the notion, suggesting it could be an excuse for a Russian escalation of its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame">faltering invasion</a> of Ukraine.

It fired ten rounds of artillery into the sea as a “warning”. </p>

<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>yen</strong> rose by 1.2% against the dollar on its Friday close before falling back during early trading on Monday, amid suggestions that Japan’s central bank is again intervening to prop up the currency. This month the yen hit its lowest level against the greenback in over 30 years, as rock-bottom Japanese interest rates diverge from America’s. Reports suggest the bank spent $30bn last week bolstering the yen.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Yangtze Memory Technologies Co</strong>, a Chinese chip company that is a darling of Beijing, asked its American employees to leave the company, as it struggles to comply with American President Joe Biden’s new <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/13/america-curbs-chinese-access-to-advanced-computing">chip-export controls</a>. The measures include a requirement for American citizens to obtain official permission to support foreign chip production. Simon Yang, CEO of YMTC, stood down at the end of September amid growing Sino-American trade tensions.</p>

<h3>The Trump Organisation on trial</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The inner workings of Donald Trump’s real-estate business will be exposed this week when the Trump Organisation faces a criminal trial in New York. Prosecutors allege that the firm dodged taxes by paying its employees off the books. In August Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer, pled guilty to 15 counts including tax fraud—his under-the-table compensation included an apartment and grandchildren’s school fees. In exchange for a reduced prison sentence he will testify against the company in the trial, which begins on Monday. If convicted it could owe up to $1.6m in fines and back taxes.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s former president is not on trial this time. But he faces separate civil charges of fraudulently <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/21/donald-trump-faces-a-sweeping-new-lawsuit">inflating</a> the value of his real-estate assets. Federal prosecutors are also probing his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his mishandling of classified documents. Notoriously litigious as a businessman, Mr Trump may soon find himself on the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in">other side of the dock</a>.</p>
<h3>Rishi Sunak will be Britain’s next prime minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/03/19/does-rishi-sunak-have-the-stomach-for-what-he-must-swallow">Rishi Sunak</a>, a former chancellor, will be Britain’s next prime minister after <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/15/who-is-penny-mordaunt">Penny Mordaunt</a>, his sole remaining rival, pulled out of the race. Ms Mordaunt failed to get enough support from other MPs and, in defeat, promised to “unite and work together for the good of the nation”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There is plenty to be done. Once Mr Sunak is ensconced in 10 Downing Street—which is expected to happen on Tuesday—he will be the country’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/20/who-will-be-britains-next-leader">third prime minister this year</a> and its fifth since 2016. He inherits a fratricidal party, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/08/the-cost-of-living-crisis-in-britain-is-not-just-about-energy">cost-of-living crisis</a> and a pressing need to balance the fiscal books. He is a safer pair of hands than Liz Truss, his hapless predecessor: the pound rallied against the dollar on news of his ascension. Mr Sunak represents change in other ways too. The grandson of Indian immigrants, he is Britain’s first non-white leader, and, at 42, the youngest since the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<h3>Peace talks in Ethiopia’s civil war</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">At first glance it appears to be a breakthrough. Nearly two years into a devastating and bloody<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/13/ethnic-cleansing-of-tigrayans-may-prolong-ethiopias-civil-war"> civil war</a>, representatives from Ethiopia’s government and the embattled Tigray region will meet on Monday in South Africa. Convened by the African Union, these are the first official peace talks since the war began. They come as Ethiopian federal troops and their Eritrean allies<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://twitter.com/MapEthiopia/status/1583903123147751424?s=20&amp;t=Bp-8b-wmrc5Y00sa-paQ0A"> advance steadily</a> towards Mekele, Tigray’s capital. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Though both sides accepted the invitation, the Tigrayans have doubts. They have previously suggested that the AU’s chief mediator, Olusegun Obasanjo, a former Nigerian president, is biased towards Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister. They want Abiy to call off his offensive before starting talks. They are also demanding that he lift his blockade of Tigray, which is<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2021/10/09/ethiopia-is-deliberately-starving-its-own-citizens"> causing mass starvation</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Tigrayans’ scepticism is warranted. Abiy has yet to demonstrate he is serious about negotiations and begins them without having made a single significant concession. Do not expect one imminently.</p>
<h3>India’s pollution season</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Hindu festival of Diwali, which this year falls on Monday, celebrates the victory of light over darkness. But for large parts of northern India, it also heralds the start of something dark: pollution season. In autumn and winter India’s air becomes increasingly toxic as the Himalayas trap the emissions of the 600m people who populate the sprawling Indo-Gangetic Plain. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2021/11/05/why-is-indias-air-so-toxic">Sources of contamination</a> are manifold. Some comes from industry and transport; some from farmers burning crop waste; and some from homes burning biomass for fuel. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">India’s government <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/11/06/indias-toxic-air-is-its-most-immediate-environmental-problem">has not ignored air pollution</a> but struggles to control the smog. The pandemic did provide some respite. In Delhi, the capital, levels of PM2.5, the most dangerous particles, improved by 20% in the past three years compared with the pre-pandemic average. But the worry is that as India’s economy returns to normality, so will pollution. Even before Diwali Delhi’s air has become dangerously unhealthy.</p>
<h3>Qatar’s Art Mill Museum</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Football will be the focus of attention in Qatar when the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/football-is-bouncing-back-from-a-difficult-period">World Cup</a> is held there later this year. But some visiting fans may also take advantage of the country’s excellent museums. The Museum of Islamic Art, which <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2008/11/20/smart-art-mart">opened</a> to huge acclaim in 2008, has been completely redesigned and will soon have additional galleries. Some visitors to Doha might also enjoy an exhibition showcasing plans for another museum, which is due to open by the end of the decade.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">“Art Mill Museum 2030”, which opens on Monday, introduces a project to redevelop an industrial flour mill in Doha’s cultural district into a waterfront exhibition space. The exhibition will be held on the site and in its garden. The plan is to remodel the mill’s enormous silos and grain elevators into one of the Gulf’s most exciting venues for showing modern and contemporary art, as well as architecture, design, craft, film and fashion. Qatar’s artistic ambitions are almost as big as its sporting ones.</p>
