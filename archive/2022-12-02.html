<p class="customisedFont">Diplomats from the <strong>EU</strong> agreed on a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/30/the-wests-proposed-price-cap-on-russian-oil-is-no-magic-weapon">price cap</a> for <strong>Russian oil</strong> of $60 per barrel, according to Poland’s ambassador. The policy aims to squeeze Russia’s revenue by prohibiting Western firms from insuring, shipping or trading Russian crude anywhere in the world unless it is sold below the cap. The G7 is expected to endorse the plan soon. Separately, an EU embargo on Russian crude takes effect on Monday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Kremlin said that <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, Russia’s president, is “open to negotiations” with <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, but only if the West accepts his country’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/05/russias-annexations-in-ukraine-are-a-legal-and-strategic-mess">annexation</a> of Ukrainian territories. During <strong>Emmanuel Macron’s</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/24/on-a-visit-to-america-frances-president-will-confront-new-problems">state visit</a> to America, Mr Biden said he was “prepared to speak with” Mr Putin, as Mr Macron has, if the Russian president signalled an interest in ending the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Employers in <strong>America</strong> added more jobs than expected—263,000—to <strong>non-farm payrolls</strong> in November. A separate household survey showed that 186,000 people left the labour force, putting <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/why-american-unemployment-needs-to-rise">pressure on wages</a>, which rose by 0.6% in November from the previous month. Strong hiring and pay growth are unlikely to deter the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> from its highly telegraphed plan to ease interest-rate increases in December.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China </strong>began adjusting to what the country’s<strong> covid</strong> tsar, Sun Chunlan, called a “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/01/xi-jinpings-zero-covid-policy-has-turned-a-health-crisis-into-a-political-one">new stage</a>” in the fight against the virus, after a wave of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest">protests</a>. Authorities in two major cities, Chengdu and Tianjin, announced a further easing of covid curbs. Meanwhile <strong>Kristalina Georgieva</strong>, head of the IMF, said China’s covid strategy would be “critical” in determining Asia’s economic future amid an “exceptionally uncertain” outlook. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Germany’s</strong> exports dropped more than anticipated in October, official data showed, as high inflation and supply-chain issues continued to bite. Exports fell by 0.6%, the second consecutive monthly decline after a drop of 0.7% in September. The news tempers optimism that the country faces a milder recession than expected after growth figures for the third quarter, announced last week, beat forecasts. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine</strong> has lost between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers since <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis">the war</a> began, according to a senior official. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, also suggested that around 100,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Meanwhile Ukraine’s army said Russia is using nuclear-capable missiles armed with non-explosive warheads to “exhaust” the country’s air-defence systems. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">David Malpass, the president of the <strong>World Bank</strong>, warned that the growing debt burden of poor countries is increasing the risk of defaults. Mr Malpass said poor countries owe their creditors $62bn this year, about 35% more than in 2021. He called for better debt-restructuring processes, especially from China, the biggest creditor to poor countries.</p>

<h3>The Trump Organisation on trial</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday the closing arguments in a criminal trial of two units of the Trump Organisation are expected to conclude. The real-estate company owned by Donald Trump, a former president, is charged with crimes including conspiracy, tax fraud and falsifying business records. Jurors heard Allen Weisselberg, the company’s chief financial officer, admit to concealing $1.76m of “bonus” income, including payment of rent for an apartment and private-school tuition. Donald Bender, who managed the organisation’s taxes for 35 years, said that he “probably would have had a heart attack” had he known about the payments. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Prosecutors allege that the company engaged in a long-running tax-avoidance scheme. The defence maintains that neither Mr Trump (who is not charged with wrongdoing) or his family knew, and that the company did not benefit from it. But, if convicted on all counts, the Trump Organisation could face $1.6m in fines. Separately, New York State’s attorney-general has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/21/donald-trump-faces-a-sweeping-new-lawsuit">filed a lawsuit</a> against Mr Trump and his family, which accuses them of “staggering fraud” and seeks damages of at least $250m. They deny the charges. That case is expected to go to trial next year, as Mr Trump’s presidential campaign gets going. </p>
<h3>British politicians visit Taiwan</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday a group of British lawmakers will conclude a visit to Taiwan designed to assess the effectiveness of Britain’s foreign policy in the region. They met Tsai Ing-wen, the president of the self-governing island that China regards as part of its territory. “Taiwan does not stand alone,” said Alicia Kearns, a Conservative MP leading the visit. China called the trip “gross interference”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The MPs are the latest in a string of international guests that Ms Tsai has welcomed since a visit by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, enraged China in August. Ms Tsai has been keen to demonstrate her strength as a leader who can garner the global support necessary to fend off an increasingly bellicose China. But after her party’s drubbing in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/29/across-the-taiwan-strait-another-lockdown-protest">local elections</a> last week she resigned as party leader. British politicians are increasingly hawkish on China. But they may find a Taiwanese leader who is, at least for now, deflated rather than defiant.</p>
<h3>Pakistan’s $1bn repayment deadline</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Jameel Ahmad, the governor of Pakistan’s central bank, sounded confident last week when he promised that Pakistan would repay a $1bn international bond by Friday—three days before it matures on December 5th. If that deadline is met, it will send a signal to international lenders that the country retains some degree of fiscal stability. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">It needs to: Pakistan’s economy is in tatters. The lingering effects of the covid pandemic, rocketing energy prices and the previous government’s economic mismanagement were compounded over the summer when an unusually strong monsoon deluged the country, causing more than <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/20/a-new-un-fund-for-loss-and-damage-emerges-from-cop27">$30bn of damage and financial losses</a>. Annual inflation was at 23.8% in November. The government is trying to persuade the IMF to release <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/07/28/pakistan-may-be-able-to-avoid-a-full-blown-economic-crisis">more bail-out funds</a>. But the IMF wants proof that officials are making progress on a plan to rebuild after the floods. Pakistan will need an awful lot more than confidence to get out of its current predicament.</p>
<h3>The rubbish problem of plastic pollution</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The first round of negotiations over a global plastic-pollution treaty will conclude in Uruguay on Friday. In March 175 countries endorsed the idea of a UN accord governing <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2020/06/22/covid-19-has-led-to-a-pandemic-of-plastic-pollution">plastic waste</a>, which has been found everywhere from the deepest part of the ocean to the tip of Mount Everest. Delegates gathered this week in Punta del Este, a beach town, to decide what the accord should say. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Some parties—including Britain, Canada, the EU and Switzerland—want the final treaty to be binding, and to set a goal of stopping plastic pollution by 2040. America agrees with the aim but favours voluntary action and doesn’t want new curbs on production. Some 19% of the world’s plastic is made in North America, 31% in China.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Plastic pollution causes about $100bn-worth of damages and clean-up costs each year, according to one estimate. Just 9% of the stuff is recycled. But countries have until the end of 2024 to finalise an accord. An effective one is far from being in the bag. </p>
<h3>A famous Christmas painting returns in London</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">This week “The Nativity” by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2013/02/16/divine-splendour">Piero della Francesca</a>, one of the most popular paintings in London’s National Gallery, returns to public view after three years’ absence. Painted around 1480, this Christmas-card favourite shows an angelic boy-band serenading the infant Jesus and his blue-robed mother against a luminous Tuscan landscape. Rugged shepherds and farmyard beasts complete the familiar, charming scene. Yet scholars have long lamented the sorry state of the oil-painted panel, which was purchased by the gallery in 1874. Much of the paint had faded and the figures lacked shadows. Plus the bald, sandy foreground led some experts to declare the painting unfinished. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The three-year restoration project, led by Jill Dunkerton, the gallery’s senior restorer, has healed the wounds inflicted by clumsy 19th-century cleaners. It has also confirmed that the painting is complete. Piero envisaged that earthy Tuscan hilltop as bare and shadowless: an uncluttered stage to better show the brilliant mystic light of Jesus’s birth. Art-lovers can now get even more enjoyment from Piero’s blend of the miraculous and the mundane.</p>
