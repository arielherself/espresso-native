<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>Earth’s temperatures </strong>over the past eight years were the hottest on record, according to a new report presented in Egypt at the opening session of <strong>COP27</strong>, the UN’s annual climate summit. The World Meteorological Organisation also said sea levels are rising twice as fast as 30 years ago. After 48 hours of wrangling, delegates finalised the talks’ agenda. For the first time, it includes “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage">loss-and-damage</a>” financing, which calls on rich countries, including those most responsible for historical emissions of greenhouse gases, to compensate poor countries for the consequences of climate change.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Apple</strong> warned that <strong>covid-19 lockdowns </strong>in China would hinder production of its newest iPhone. The firm said a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/24/the-end-of-apples-affair-with-china">factory in Zhengzhou</a>, where the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max are assembled, was operating at “significantly reduced capacity”. That will mean fewer shipments and longer wait times, just as the holidays approach. Chinese health officials meanwhile reported the highest caseload since May and reiterated their commitment to a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/03/the-chinese-city-that-covid-forgot">zero-covid</a> policy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Twitter</strong> has reportedly asked some sacked workers to return, after cutting half its staff last week; apparently dozens were laid off accidentally. Meanwhile, CNN reported that the rollout of a controversial “blue-check” <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/03/will-people-pay-8-a-month-for-twitter">subscription plan</a> will be delayed till after the midterms in America. And Elon Musk, who said he <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">bought the company</a> to protect free speech, declared that users who impersonate others will be “permanently suspended”. Several had changed their handles to mock him.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russian-installed officials</strong> in Kherson in southern <strong>Ukraine </strong>said that the city had lost water and electricity supplies because of “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/10/20/vladimir-putin-says-the-worlds-energy-infrastructure-is-at-risk">sabotage</a>”. The announcement comes amid a rumoured Russian withdrawal from the city to the eastern bank of the Dnieper river. Meanwhile, Ukraine claimed that the Russians were destroying civilian boats on the Dnieper, presumably to slow any Ukrainian attempt at pursuit. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Nearly 230 parliamentarians in <strong>Iran</strong> signed a vindictive statement demanding that the country’s judiciary show “no leniency” to “rioters” <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/could-irans-regime-fall">protesting against the regime</a>. Unrest continued in many Iranian cities through the weekend. Activists reported that security forces fired on crowds in Marivan in Kurdistan province after the funeral of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/26/will-irans-women-win">female protester</a>, Nasrin Ghaderi, who died on Saturday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea</strong> characterised its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many">missile launches</a> of last week as a “simulated attack” against its South Korean and American enemies, and as retaliation for their joint drills. South Korean military officials said they recovered bits of a short-range ballistic weapon near its shore. And <strong>Japan’s </strong>prime minister, Kishida Fumio, promised to increase his country’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/13/war-in-ukraine-has-bolstered-japans-support-for-a-stronger-army">defence capabilities</a>, in response to both North Korean and Russian provocations.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Researchers in Britain conducted the first <strong>transfusion</strong> of <strong>lab-grown blood</strong> to human patients. The red-blood cells were grown from donor stem cells. If successful, such transfusions could alleviate a shortage of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2017/06/14/the-global-inequality-of-blood-supplies">blood donations</a> and aid treatment of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/new-therapies-for-a-range-of-conditions-are-coming-in-2022">blood disorders</a>, such as sickle-cell disease and ​​thalassemia. The trial, by the University of Bristol and the NHS, will involve at least ten patients.</p>

<h3>What’s at stake in America’s midterms?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Every two years Americans go to the polls to decide which congressmen and senators to hire and fire. But election day, on Tuesday, has consequences far beyond Capitol Hill. Voters also pick representatives for their state legislatures, where most policy in America is made. They elect mayors, governors and judges—and they vote on scores of local ballot measures. This year that means deciding on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/22/republicans-abortion-proposal-could-backfire">abortion</a> and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/20/how-americas-midterms-could-reshape-the-courts">voting rights</a>, alongside many other issues. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/mid-terms-2022">midterms</a> are an enormous democratic exercise.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But American democracy is being questioned by some Republicans. A big theme of this year’s midterms is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/11/01/arizonas-midterm-races-are-full-of-election-deniers">the rise of election deniers</a>, who argue that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent, and that Donald Trump is the rightful president. Many of these candidates are running for local positions, such as secretary of state, that oversee elections. Their victories in important swing states like Arizona and Michigan could affect how future elections are run. The 2024 presidential campaign is already looming. </p>
<h3>A turbulent time for global trade</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday the World Trade Organisation publishes its annual report on global trade, the vast majority of which is conducted through the system the WTO oversees. It comes at a fraught moment. Global goods trade bounced back strongly after a deep downturn in 2020, despite many <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/01/29/why-supply-chain-problems-arent-going-away">supply-chain problems</a>. In 2021 trade reached its highest level as a share of world GDP since 2014 and has risen again in 2022, according to the WTO’s current estimates.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But troubles loom. Over the coming year growth is expected to slow sharply; America, China and Europe are all at risk of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/recession">recessions</a>. Protectionism is increasing. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, China and the West are trying to reduce their <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/10/10/why-america-and-europe-fret-about-china-turning-inwards">interdependency</a> for critical resources and technologies. America’s forays into industrial policy—including the “Buy America” rules written into a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/08/americas-climate-plus-spending-bill-is-flawed-but-essential">new climate law</a>—have irked its trade partners in Europe and Asia. In time the post-pandemic rebound in trade may seem more a last hurrah than a new dawn.</p>
<h3>How Western weapons are helping Ukraine</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In the coming days, Ukraine will receive two National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems developed by Kongsberg, a Norwegian aerospace company, and Raytheon, an American one. In October Ukraine received an advanced IRIS-T air-defence system from Germany, which has promised them three more. Slovakia provided a battery of missiles months ago.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Such weapons are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/06/western-air-defence-systems-help-ukraine-shoot-down-more-missiles">helping Ukraine protect itself</a>. On October 10th, nearly half of the missiles and drones launched by Russia dodged Ukrainian defences; now the country claims to be shooting down over 80% of the missiles and drones that come its way. The danger is still immense. Over the past month, Russian attacks have destroyed or damaged up to 40% of the country’s energy infrastructure, triggering widespread power cuts. (There are plans to evacuate Kyiv, the capital, in the event of a prolonged blackout.) America wants to increase the speed with which it hands over six additional NASAM systems. For Ukrainians, these deliveries cannot come fast enough. </p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical firms’ uncertain post-pandemic future</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">BioNTech, the German <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/10/after-a-covid-fuelled-adrenaline-rush-biotech-is-crashing">biotechnology company</a> that partnered with Pfizer to produce a widely used covid-19 vaccination, releases its third-quarter results on Monday. They will be watched closely by those wanting to scry <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/13/which-covid-19-vaccine-saved-the-most-lives-in-2021">jab-makers’</a> futures as the pandemic wanes. Pfizer, an American firm, beat analysts’ expectations last week, reporting $22.6bn in third-quarter sales. “We believe our covid-19 franchises will remain multibillion-dollar revenue generators for the foreseeable future,” said Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chief executive. Yet Moderna, another American vaccine manufacturer, fared poorly, citing complex manufacturing issues and writing off $333m of expired inventory.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech have increased the prices of their covid-19 products to offset anticipated slowdowns and are under pressure to diversify their drug portfolios for a post-pandemic era. BioNTech is also hoping to drive sales with its new covid booster jab, which has already proved more effective against the Omicron variant than the original version it developed with Pfizer. But as the coronavirus slips down governments’ agendas, even that might not bolster its bottom line for long.</p>
<h3>“Bardo” and the burdens of creation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Artistic angst pervades “Bardo: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths”, which was released in a limited number of American cinemas by Netflix on Friday. (It will air on the streaming service in December.) The film follows a journalist-cum-filmmaker through a midlife crisis, expressed through a fugue of memories and visions. The inciting event is an awards ceremony—familiar territory for Alejandro González Iñárritu, the film’s Mexican director who has won Academy Awards for “The Revenant” and “Birdman”, among others.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Silverio Gama, the film’s fictional documentarian, finds that success does not soothe his discontent. Instead, he is haunted by ghosts from Mexico’s conquistador past and the drug wars of its present and wonders about his stature among his clubby colleagues. The film is an anxious examination of how an artist and his work are perceived, and on the pressure to seem sufficiently responsive to the concerns of the times. It joins <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/28/tar-official-competition-and-bardo-probe-creative-integrity">a recent spate of films</a> examining the challenges of creativity, notably “Blonde” and “Elvis”, two biopics about Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley respectively.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
