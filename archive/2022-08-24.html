<p class="customisedFont">Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s president, warned of “hideous Russian provocations and brutal strikes” ahead of his country’s independence day on Wednesday. The day also marks the six-month anniversary of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis">Russia’s invasion</a>. America is expected to announce a fresh package of military aid worth $3bn. Separately the UN’s nuclear watchdog said it would assess the safety and security at Zaporizhia, the site of Europe’s largest nuclear plant and intense fighting, over the next few days. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Democrats voting in <strong>Florida </strong>chose a former Republican governor of the state,<strong> Charlie Crist</strong>, as their champion in the race to unseat the incumbent Republican, <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>. Mr DeSantis is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/02/05/why-florida-is-lurching-to-the-right">popular</a>, and often mentioned hopefully as an alternative to Donald Trump in future presidential races. Democrats also opted for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/03/30/two-elections-will-attract-national-interest">Val Demings</a>, as their challenger for the Senate; she would face Marco Rubio, whom Mr Trump bested in 2016.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Intel </strong>struck a deal worth $30bn with <strong>Brookfield</strong>, a Canadian asset-management firm, to finance factory construction in the state of Arizona. Under the agreement the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/03/31/intel-should-beware-of-becoming-a-national-champion">American chip-maker</a> would fund 51% of the cost but the two firms would split revenues from the new factories. Intel is hoping to regain a manufacturing advantage over its competitors in Taiwan and South Korea. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>Adani Group</strong>, a sprawling <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/06/19/a-strange-news-report-briefly-rattles-the-adani-group">Indian conglomerate</a>, bought up 29% of <strong>NDTV</strong>, the country’s most prominent English-language news broadcaster, and opened a bid to secure a majority stake. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/08/07/the-many-sides-to-gautam-adani">Gautam Adani</a>, a billionaire who recently became the richest man in Asia, enjoys close ties to India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. NDTV, which has maintained a rare reputation of editorial independence, complained that the bid was hostile.</p>

<p class="customisedFont">America’s National Archives recovered more than 700 pages of <strong>classified material </strong>from <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> Mar-a-Lago estate in January, according to a letter the agency sent to the former president’s lawyer. These included documents “at the highest levels of classification”—more of which were seized by the FBI during a raid this month. Mr Trump is suing the Department of Justice over an investigation into the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations">confidential documents</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s private-sector</strong> activity contracted for a second month in August, according to S&amp;P Global’s flash survey of purchasing managers. The service sector recorded a steeper rate of decline than industry as inflation choked demand. The dollar and short-dated government bond yields reversed their recent climb amid fresh <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/06/01/what-americas-next-recession-will-look-like">fretting about America’s economy</a>.</p>

Mr Najib was found guilty in July 2020 of illegally receiving about $10m from a former unit of 1MDB, charges that he denies. He was sentenced to 12 years in jail and a 210m ringgit ($46.8m) fine</p>

<h3>Will the sun shine red in Florida?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday Floridians will head to the polls in the state’s last major primary of the year. Turnout and voters’ choices in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/03/30/two-elections-will-attract-national-interest">Sunshine State</a>, which has drifted towards the Republican party in recent years, will be a gauge of the Democrats’ prospects in the mid-term elections.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Watch who Democrats choose as their gubernatorial candidate to challenge <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/02/05/why-florida-is-lurching-to-the-right">Ron DeSantis</a>, the Republican incumbent. The most likely choices are Charlie Crist, a former governor, or Nikki Fried, the state’s commissioner of agriculture. But neither has the campaign chest nor the name recognition to beat the popular Mr DeSantis, who is among the top potential Republican presidential contenders for 2024.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Floridians will also pick the Democratic contender for the Senate. Val Demings, a former police chief in Orlando, is the only candidate who could mount a meaningful challenge to Marco Rubio, a Republican and the current senator, in November. Polls that show her leading against Mr Rubio have encouraged national Democratic donors to pile in. </p>
<h3>The euro zone’s autumn of discontent</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">If recent surveys are any indication, growth in the euro zone is about to start slowing. The services sector, which had bounced back from a slowdown caused by the pandemic, is flagging as the tourist season ends. A severe energy crunch has probably already sent industry into<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/12/what-is-a-recession"> recession</a>. Tuesday&#x27;s release of purchasing managers’ index figures is adding to the gloomy mood.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Both manufacturing and services indicators continued to slide, though a bit less than feared. That will still be a headache for Europe’s politicians and monetary authorities alike. Governments are already under pressure to combat soaring energy bills with price caps and cash transfers. A weaker economy could dry up tax revenues. Businesses may start asking for tax cuts or cash compensation, too. The European Central Bank knows that<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/21/the-ecbs-latest-attempt-to-hold-the-euro-zone-together"> interest-rate increases</a>, while necessary to contain inflation, will inflict economic pain. The autumn of discontent may begin early this year.</p>
<h3>Russia tries to set Syria straight</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">While its war rages in Ukraine, Russia is struggling to stabilise its conflict-battered satellite in the Middle East, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is meeting his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad, in Moscow on Tuesday. Syria wants assurances that Russia will not divert more forces away from Mr Assad’s civil war to the front in Ukraine. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation">The Wagner Group</a>, a shadowy Russian-backed private security contractor in Syria, has already scaled back its operations. Syria’s cash-poor government also desperately needs grain.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Russia has demands, too. Turkey’s membership of NATO and location on the Black Sea makes its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2021/02/23/putin-and-erdogan-have-formed-a-brotherhood-of-hard-power">co-operation</a> critical for Russia’s war in Ukraine. So Russia wants Mr Assad to make <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2020/03/05/as-turkey-pounds-the-syrian-army-russia-wants-to-talk">peace with his foe</a>, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president. That would require Mr Assad to facilitate the return of Syrian refugees from Turkey and start reconciling with the Turkish-backed rebels in Syria’s north. But so far Russian efforts to push Mr Assad to accept a political settlement have come to nothing. </p>
<h3>China’s JD.com trots forward</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The worst is over for China’s embattled tech companies. But so is the best. Their share prices have bounced back from lows in March, but remain far below their peaks in early 2021. The ferocity of the long regulatory crackdown on the sector (including fines for unfair competition and stricter policing of data) has diminished somewhat. But China’s equally <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/06/16/in-stamping-out-covid-china-has-stomped-on-confidence">relentless fight against covid-19</a> has also hurt business.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/05/26/alibaba-v-tencent-the-battle-for-chinas-e-commerce-deliveries">Alibaba and Tencent</a> both reported a decline in their revenues last quarter, compared with a year earlier. JD.com, a third tech giant, did better, reporting revenue growth of 5.4% on Tuesday. Unlike many tech companies, it owns much of its distribution network (employing over 220,000 delivery staff). That may have helped shield it from the worst of last quarter&#x27;s supply-chain disruptions. The number of jobs it creates may also earn it some political goodwill. But the company’s growth will still be bridled. As one of its executives recently put it, there will be no return to “riding the horse without holding the reins”.</p>
<h3>The first whistle blows for Ukrainian football</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When Russia invaded, football, like so much else in Ukraine, ground to a halt. Foreign professional players fled the country while many of their Ukrainian counterparts enlisted. Clubs used their infrastructure to provide humanitarian relief. But on Tuesday the ball starts rolling again. The Ukrainian Premier League, the country’s top football division, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/08/19/ukraines-new-football-season-isnt-all-about-the-sport">returns for a new season</a>. Fans will not be allowed in the stadiums, which will be fitted with air-raid shelters to protect players and officials in case of Russian shelling.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The restart is a calculated risk to help small clubs struggling for revenue. But it is also a boost to the country’s morale. The opening match between FC Shakhtar, a club exiled from the Russian-occupied province of Donetsk since 2014, and Metalist 1925 from Kharkiv, a city bombarded by the Russians, ended in a 0-0 draw. But this year survival, not football, is the name of the game.</p>
