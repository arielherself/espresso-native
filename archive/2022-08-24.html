<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Joe Biden</strong> announced nearly <strong>$3bn of military assistance</strong> to Ukraine as he congratulated the country on its independence day, which coincides with the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/europe/2022/08/24/six-months-of-war-in-ukraine">six-month</a> anniversary of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis">Russia’s invasion</a>. Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, said the country had been “reborn” through its resistance to Russia’s aggression. He also vowed to regain Russian-occupied regions, including Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014. Earlier Mr Zelensky warned of “hideous Russian provocations” ahead of the Ukrainian national holiday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Japan’s </strong>prime minister, Kishida Fumio, said on Wednesday that his country will consider building a new generation of <strong>nuclear-power reactors</strong> as it prepares to restart plants left idle since the Fukushima disaster of 2011. The global surge in energy prices helped prompt an about-face. There remains work to be done, Mr Kishida implied, in convincing the public that this counts towards Japan’s “green transformation”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Thailand’s</strong> Constitutional Court suspended the prime minister, <strong>Prayuth Chan-ocha</strong>, in response to a petition filed by the main opposition party.

<h3>Six months of Russia’s war in Ukraine</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Wednesday marks the six-month anniversary of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/23/the-war-where-almost-nothing-is-what-it-seems">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>. Russia has failed to meet any of its military objectives: conquering Kyiv, the capital, capturing the eastern Donbas region or seizing Ukraine’s coastline. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/24/how-heavy-are-russian-casualties-in-ukraine">Around 15,000 Russians</a> have been killed, according to the Pentagon, roughly the same number that died in the Soviet Union’s decade-long occupation of Afghanistan. The frontlines have barely moved in recent weeks, though Ukraine hopes to push Russian troops out of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/17/stay-cool-on-kherson">Kherson</a>, a city in the south, in the coming months. Both armies are exhausted.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Kremlin’s gamble is that American and European support for Ukraine will fall away over the winter, as spiralling <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/11/which-european-countries-are-most-vulnerable-to-surging-energy-prices">gas prices</a> pile on domestic pressures. That, in turn, could pave the way for a deal that leaves perhaps one-fifth of the country in Russian hands. Ukraine, unwilling to accept its dismemberment, will <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/11/wrecked-planes-smoulder-at-russias-saky-airbase-in-crimea">hit back</a> with rocket strikes and partisan activity. No one thinks the war will be over by Christmas. </p>

Our </em><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/23/the-war-where-almost-nothing-is-what-it-seems"><em>new leader</em></a><em> reflects on a war where almost nothing is as it seems</em></p>
<h3>Oil and toil: elections in Angola</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For nearly three decades the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), Angola’s ruling party, fought an on-off civil war with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The MPLA won in 2002, ushering in a period of peace and multi-party democracy. On Wednesday the southern African country will hold its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/18/a-dictators-ghost-haunts-angolas-upcoming-elections">fifth general election</a>. There are few other reasons to celebrate, though. President João Lourenço, who replaced <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/14/jose-eduardo-dos-santos-who-plundered-angola-has-died">José Eduardo dos Santos</a> in 2017 on pledges to cut back graft and reform the economy, has disappointed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Angolans are frustrated that their oil-dependent state serves only a small elite, leaving the majority in poverty. Such sentiment has bolstered support for UNITA. Yet the MPLA has used its hold on the state apparatus to hound its old foe, in the courts and beyond. This paranoid party, dominated by securocrats, looks set to remain in power, spouting revolutionary rhetoric while gorging on the fruits of crony capitalism.</p>
<h3>Chipping at Nvidia’s bottom line</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Nvidia, one of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/08/01/will-nvidias-huge-bet-on-artificial-intelligence-chips-pay-off">world’s leading chip companies</a>, reports its financial results on Wednesday. They will be dire. So bad, in fact, that the firm offered a preview earlier this month, hoping to dampen the shock to the markets. The Californian company said it expected to book revenues of $6.7bn in the second financial quarter ended in July, down by 19% from the same period last year and 17% lower than the $8.1bn it had forecast in May. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The culprit is weaker post-pandemic demand for electronics, especially high-end gaming systems, for which Nvidia supplies powerful graphics chips. Many of those cards had also been used to mine cryptocurrencies, and the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/05/12/the-crypto-infrastructure-cracks">crypto meltdown</a> has sapped demand here, too. Nvidia’s rivals—<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/intels-turnaround-and-the-future-of-chipmaking/21804288">Intel</a>, Qualcomm and AMD—have also missed revenue forecasts. On his earnings call Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, will be trying hard to show investors a path back to growth.</p>
<h3>Britain reins in the hosepipes</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Britain, like much of the world, is parched. July this year was the driest since 1935. On Wednesday Thames Water, London’s main water utility, imposed a hosepipe ban on its 15m customers, to curtail the cleaning of cars, filling of pools and watering of gardens. Other water companies across southern England and Wales have already taken similar steps.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Water firms reckon such measures typically cut usage by around 10%. But evidence suggests that the less radical measure of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/11/better-measurement-would-help-reduce-water-consumption">simply informing people</a> about their water consumption could help more. Almost half of respondents to a survey in 2020 said they used less than 20 litres a day. The true figure is closer to 150 litres. Water meters typically reduce usage by around 15%, but are deployed in only 60% of British homes. They can help identify leaks, too. Nearly one-fifth of Britain’s drinking water is lost to burst pipes, which become more frequent in extreme heat. </p>
<h3>Welsh football goes to Hollywood</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It was the kind of change of fate that usually only happens in films. In September 2020 Ryan Reynolds, star of “Deadpool”, and Rob McElhenney, the creator of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”, a sitcom, announced their intention to buy Wrexham FC. The club, the oldest in Wales, was languishing in the fifth tier of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2018/07/12/english-or-british-football-highlights-an-enduring-identity-crisis">Britain’s football leagues</a>. The Hollywood actors were not lifelong footie fans. They had no experience running such an institution. “We had no direct connection,” Mr McElhenney told a supporter. “It was just a feeling.” Mr McElhenney also said that Wrexham reminded him of the working-class Philadelphia of his childhood.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Naturally, the pair brought along a camera crew to chart the ups and downs of their inaugural season. On Wednesday “Welcome to Wrexham”, the resulting docuseries, premieres in America on FX; one day later it will be released in Britain on Disney+. The series is poignant, and often funny. Wrexham’s fans and staff have high hopes for their club under its new management. Mr Reynolds, too, hopes it will triumph on the field. “It’s an underdog story,” he says. And it still is: since the takeover, Wrexham have remained in the fifth tier.</p>
