<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong>, the leader of Britain’s opposition, called for a general election after <strong>Liz Truss</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/10/20/liz-truss-is-britains-shortest-serving-prime-minister">resigned as prime minister</a>. He said that the potential return of Boris Johnson, Ms Truss’s predecessor, was the “most powerful argument” against “continuing with this chaos” of Conservative Party rule. Some MPs are canvassing for Mr Johnson to take over. The pound fell and gilt yields rose on Friday after official data showed that public sector borrowing in September was higher than predicted, and retail sales lower. Markets have been tumultuous since the government’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/14/liz-truss-has-lost-her-chancellor-signature-tax-cut-and-authority">disastrous “mini-budget”</a> on September 23rd.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America said military personnel from <strong>Iran </strong>were on the ground in Crimea, helping <strong>Russia</strong> launch drone attacks against <strong>Ukraine</strong>. A spokesman for the White House said America would “pursue all means” to “expose, deter and confront” Iranian support to Russia. Britain joined the EU in imposing new sanctions on Iran over its supply of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/19/will-russias-drone-attacks-change-the-war-in-ukraine">“kamikaze” drones</a> to Russia, which it used to damage Ukrainian energy infrastructure.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Inflation</strong> in <strong>Japan</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/18/prices-are-rising-in-japan-but-not-wages">climbed to reach</a> an eight-year high in September. Core consumer prices increased by 3% year on year, exceeding the central bank’s 2% target for a sixth consecutive month. The Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, even as the yen has tumbled. It slid to 150 per dollar on Thursday, its lowest rate since 1990.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>EU leaders</strong> agreed to continue work towards a possible price cap to “immediately limit” <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/13/europe-is-growing-complacent-about-its-energy-crisis">spikes</a> in the early hours of Friday. France, Italy and Spain have long pushed for a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/27/the-wrong-way-to-solve-europes-energy-crisis">price ceiling</a> in response to the energy crunch; Germany has opposed the market intervention arguing that it could hurt future supply.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Twitter</strong> told its employees that there were no plans for lay-offs, despite reports that <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, the social-media firm’s prospective owner, wants to sack nearly three-quarters of its 7,500 staff. Mr Musk reportedly said that job cuts would mark the start of his<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up"> shake-up</a> of Twitter, whose profits lag behind its competitors’.

The cost will rise to between $110 and $130 per dose, as the drugmaker tries to offset the financial effects of weak demand for booster vaccines. Angela Lukin, a Pfizer executive, said that the vaccine will remain free for Americans with either private or government-paid insurance.</p>

<h3>Britain’s political déjà vu</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Conservative politicians in Britain are, once again, squabbling about who should lead both their party and the country. On Thursday Liz Truss resigned as prime minister <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/20/who-will-be-britains-next-leader">after just 45 days in office</a>. Candidates hoping to replace her must secure the support of 100 of their colleagues to qualify for an expedited leadership contest to be completed within the next week. No one has yet officially thrown their hat in the ring, but likely contenders include Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor; Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons; and Boris Johnson, the scandal-prone former prime minister. Of these, Mr Sunak currently seems the most popular with MPs.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Truss departs amid widespread derision. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, stressed the need for Britain to find “stability”. Anthony Albanese noted that Ms Truss’s replacement will be his third British counterpart during his five months as Australia’s prime minister. Whomever it is will inherit a mountain of problems, not least constrained finances and a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/02/18/the-conservative-party-has-become-factional-and-rebellious">nigh-on ungovernable party</a>. </p>
<h3>Steve Bannon faces the music</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former consigliere, will be sentenced by a judge in Washington for contempt of Congress. In July he was convicted of two misdemeanours for refusing to appear before a House committee <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity">investigating the Capitol riot</a> on January 6th 2021. Prosecutors have asked that he serve six months in prison and pay a $200,000 fine. They cited his “name-calling, mimicry and menacing rhetoric” towards the committee members, and his lack of remorse.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The contempt-of-Congress statute is rarely enforced. Just one other person—Peter Navarro, a former adviser to Mr Trump—was indicted for thumbing his nose at the January 6th committee, though several higher-level aides also ignored subpoenas. Justice-department guidelines suggest that senior administration officials and the president should not be forced to testify before Congress, owing to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/11/10/what-is-executive-privilege">executive privilege</a>. So do not expect contempt charges for Mr Trump if, as is expected, he disregards his own forthcoming subpoena.</p>
<h3>Europe’s LNG bottlenecks</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday France, Portugal and Spain announced a new pipeline between Barcelona and Marseille. Dubbed “BarMar”, the line is mostly intended to transport renewable gases including green hydrogen across the Mediterranean Sea, but it will also be allowed to carry a limited amount of natural gas.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The EU needs the extra capacity. As it races to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets">restock gas supplies</a> before winter, it has increasingly relied on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/02/26/if-the-supply-of-russian-gas-to-europe-were-cut-off-could-lng-plug-the-gap">liquefied natural gas</a> ferried by super-chilled tankers, often from America, to replace the stuff piped from Russia. That has helped it fill its storage to more than 90%.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet recently bottlenecks have emerged. With the continent’s limited number of regasifying terminals now running at full capacity, dozens of tankers are being forced to wait their turn, with many circling off the coasts of Spain. Next year Spain will reopen El Musel, an LNG import terminal in the Bay of Biscay that has been idle for a decade. Neither that nor the BarMar pipeline will open fast enough to alleviate the current crisis. But they will help in the future.</p>
<h3>Italy inches closer to its new government</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A delegation from the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/28/italys-next-government-may-be-more-nationalist-than-europe-likes">right-wing alliance</a> that won Italy’s general election last month visited president Sergio Mattarella on Friday, rounding off the consultations that precede the formation of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/15/italys-probable-next-government-contains-many-tensions">new government</a>. Usually, each party sends its own delegation. But the uneasy allies want to showcase their unity and readiness to govern in coalition under <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/22/how-afraid-should-europe-be-of-giorgia-meloni">Giorgia Meloni</a>, who leads the hard-right <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-brothers-of-italy-look-set-to-win-the-next-election">Brothers of Italy</a> party. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The only fly in the ointment appears to be Silvio Berlusconi, who leads the Forza Italia party. Irate at being thwarted in the share-out of cabinet seats, the former prime minister has wrought havoc. In a recording leaked on Wednesday he embarrassed Ms Meloni by boasting of his closeness to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. After Mr Berlusconi’s tantrum Mr Mattarella doubtless wanted answers to some hard questions: about whether the right is as united as it claims, and whether Mr Berlusconi’s party should, as reportedly intended, get the foreign-affairs portfolio.</p>
<h3>The melancholy wit of “The Banshees Of Inisherin”</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Martin McDonagh’s last comedy-drama, “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2017/11/08/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-finds-hope-in-tragedy">Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</a>”, won the BAFTA for Best Film, among other awards, in 2018. The playwright-turned-filmmaker’s darkly funny follow-up, which is released in cinemas on Friday, “The Banshees Of Inisherin”, is too mysterious and melancholy to earn as many prizes. Yet it is sure to win a cult following.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr McDonagh has recast the stars of his debut movie, “In Bruges”, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. The pair play old drinking buddies who live on a tiny Irish island in 1923. Their friendship comes to an abrupt halt when one of them suddenly announces that he will chop off his own fingers if he ever has to talk to the other again. That succinct, absurdist plot is all that Mr McDonagh needs to make a poetic, sharply scripted and beautifully acted meditation on kindness, depression, art, the Irish civil war—and the self-destructive stubbornness of men everywhere.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme.
