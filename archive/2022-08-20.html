<p class="customisedFont">France said <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, Russia’s president, had told his French counterpart that UN inspectors could access the <strong>Zaporizhia nuclear plant</strong> in south-eastern Ukraine. An international mission would require a temporary ceasefire around the Russian-controlled power station, which has been the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant">target of shelling</a> for weeks, said French officials. Meanwhile António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, affirmed that Zaporizhia’s electricity belongs to Ukraine, amid fears that power could be diverted to the Russian grid. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of planning further attacks at the plant.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Gazprom, <strong>Russia’s </strong>state-owned energy firm, said it would halt <strong>natural-gas</strong> deliveries to Europe via its main pipeline for three days at the end of August. It said the reason was unscheduled maintenance to <strong>Nord Stream 1</strong>, which links <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter">Russia to Germany</a> via the Baltic sea and is already running at just a fifth of its capacity.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Mexico</strong> arrested the prosecutor who had led the investigation of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2016/04/30/the-great-mystery">a notorious disappearance </a>of 43 student-teachers in 2014. With former attorney-general Jesús Murillo in custody, another 83 warrants were ordered for the arrest of other officials, police and gang members. According to Mr Murillo’s investigation, the students were murdered and dismembered by drug traffickers in a case of mistaken identity. The current government suspects the Mexican state itself played a sinister role.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Finland’s</strong> prime minister took a drug test to quell a brouhaha over video footage of her partying and dancing with friends. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2019/12/11/finlands-new-prime-minister-is-the-worlds-youngest">Sanna Marin</a>, aged 36, said the results would put to rest the “grave public accusations” that she had used drugs, though she called demands for her to take a test “unjust”. The results will be available in a week.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">At least 12 people are believed dead after an attack on a hotel in <strong>Mogadishu</strong>, the capital of Somalia. <strong>Al-Shabab</strong>, a jihadist group with links to al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for the ongoing siege. It began with car bombs on Friday night. This is the first major attack by al-Shabab since <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/07/19/somalias-president-wants-help-to-fight-africas-terrorist-groups">Hassan Sheikh Mohamud</a> was elected president in May. The group already controls much of the Somali countryside.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Britons’ <strong>consumer confidence</strong> plunged to historic lows on Friday, according to research by data provider GfK. Respondents were gloomy about all five component parts of the consumer confidence index, reflecting “a sense of exasperation about the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/11/britains-economy-is-taking-a-drubbing">UK’s economy</a>”, according to a GfK director. Separately, Britain reported a fall of 1.2% in retail sales in the three months to July.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Olaf Scholz</strong>, Germany’s chancellor, denied allegations of impropriety in his management of a multibillion-euro<strong> tax-fraud case</strong> while acting as mayor of Hamburg in 2017. Mr Scholz stands accused of deliberately failing to collect €47m ($47m) in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2020/11/19/a-tax-evasion-scandal-draws-in-hamburgs-elites">tax payments from Warburg</a>, a local bank. The investigation comes at a difficult time for Mr Scholz as he grapples with Germany’s energy crunch alongside his own dipping popularity.</p>

<h3>Navalny riles the Kremlin from jail</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Exactly two years ago the Kremlin tried to assassinate <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2020/10/17/an-interview-with-alexei-navalny-assassination-survivor">Alexei Navalny</a>, its most prominent domestic critic. He fell ill on a flight over Siberia. After being evacuated to Germany it was confirmed that he had been poisoned with Novichok, a military nerve agent. Mr Navalny returned to Russia five months later and was duly <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/04/alexei-navalnys-jailers-are-tightening-the-screws">imprisoned</a>, but he has not been cowed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Kremlin is using the war in Ukraine to silence other critics. Prominent opposition politicians have been imprisoned on sham pretexts. Prohibitions on “discrediting” the army have in effect outlawed dissent. Independent-minded Russians have <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/08/09/much-of-russias-intellectual-elite-has-fled-the-country">emigrated</a>. And all the while, Mr Navalny has continued riling the authorities from behind bars. His latest ruse was to register a trade union for prisoners. Authorities then put him in solitary confinement. Mr Navalny says he was told the move was punishment for failing to fasten the top button of his prison uniform. </p>
<h3>A rematch for boxing heavyweights</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Last September an underdog Ukrainian fighter, Oleksandr Usyk, defeated Anthony Joshua, a Briton who held three world heavyweight belts. Mr Usyk had built a successful career as a cruiserweight, but was widely expected to struggle after going up a division. Instead his superior technical skills humbled his opponent, who looked tactically naive and slow-footed. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday, in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, Mr Joshua has his rematch. If he wins, his career will be back on track and negotiations for a lucrative title-unification fight with another British heavyweight, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/04/22/scandal-overshadows-boxings-world-heavyweight-title-bout">Tyson Fury</a>, will resume. If he loses again, his career at the top of boxing will probably be over. Yet Mr Usyk has had the more difficult year. He enlisted in the Ukrainian army and his family home was temporarily seized by Russian fighters. He has ensured that the fight will be free for all Ukrainians to watch. This time, he will not be underestimated. </p>
<h3>Australia wears its mullets with pride</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Native Americans once sported mullets. So did the ancient Greeks. But Australia sees the hairstyle as a badge of its national identity. On Saturday fans of the much-derided cut gather in Dubbo, a city in New South Wales, for an annual competition to find the finest mullets Down Under. The controversial look is eternally popular in outback Australia, but its recent proliferation has ignited a national debate.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mullets have returned to fashion in the country’s professional sports leagues. They are trendy in schools and surfing communities. But not everyone is sold on the do: several private schools have banned the hairstyle and some pubs turn away mulleted men for falling short of dress codes. The issue has even percolated up to the top heads. The mullet is “a unique Australian invention—one which we’ve been selling to the world”, Western Australia’s “pro-mullet” premier, Mark McGowan, claimed last year. He advised the haircut’s fans to “rise up and rebel against these extreme rules”. </p>
<h3>What to read to understand the history of Western capitalism</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It is easy to be swept up in news about the economy, which can make it hard to step back and think about the bigger questions. Yet <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-reads/2022/07/04/what-to-read-to-understand-the-history-of-western-capitalism">economic history</a> can improve your understanding of the news. Here are five helpful resources.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>“The Worldly Philosophers”</strong> by Robert Heilbroner is an excellent introduction to the history of economic ideas. It covers everyone from Adam Smith to Thomas Malthus to Karl Marx, explaining what they thought and why.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Also try <strong>“A Culture of Growth”</strong>, by Joel Mokyr, which deals squarely with the question of why Europe was the first region to industrialise—focusing on institutions.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">And for much more European history, Jonathan Sumption’s 3,320-page <strong>“The Hundred Years’ War”</strong> shows just how different governance and politics were before capitalism.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Two of the best resources, though, are not books but journal articles. <strong>“War as an Economic Activity in the ‘Long’ Eighteenth Century”</strong>, by N.A.M. Rodger, emphasises the role of technology in economic success. In <strong>“Enclosures, Common Rights, and Women”</strong> Jane Humphries looks at the impact of that success by examining how lifestyles changed as capitalism came about.</p>

<h3>Weekend profile: Fani Willis, the local prosecutor taking on Trumpworld</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“It does not matter what your notoriety is, what your fame is, if you come to Fulton County, Georgia, and you commit crimes…we are going to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.” So said Fani Willis, the local district attorney, in May, unveiling gang-related charges against Young Thug, a Grammy-winning rapper, and 27 others. (Young Thug denies the charges.) But they could equally be seen as a warning to Donald Trump—another celebrity in Ms Willis’s sights.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For months Ms Willis has been investigating attempts by Mr Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. (Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing.) Her probe—<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/17/merrick-garland-is-not-naive-about-political-violence">one of several</a> he faces—is sprawling. Among its targets are Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump’s former lawyer, and the Republican “fake electors” who falsely tried to certify the vote for the former president. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Charges, if and when they come, might allege a co-ordinated, criminal scheme to commit election fraud. Ms Willis has a history of using racketeering laws, which target criminal “enterprises” like the Mafia. In 2013 she used these laws to secure an indictment against teachers and administrators for inflating pupils’ exam scores, in a case that made national headlines; 11 of the 12 defendants were convicted. Her charges against Young Thug’s cohort also allege racketeering.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Willis is a formidable opponent. Described as a “street-fighter” in the courtroom, she has spent most of her career in the office she now leads. In 2020 she handily beat her former boss to win the top job. On her first day as district attorney, news broke of Mr Trump’s demand that Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s elections chief, “find 11,780 votes”. That notorious call launched a career-defining probe.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Willis maintains that she takes “no pleasure” in going after a former president. Opponents say she is on a politically motivated crusade. Last month a judge scolded her for hosting a fundraiser for the Democratic rival of a Republican whom she was investigating, and disqualified her from pursuing him.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Her inquiry is likely to last for months yet. As it gathers pace, Trumpworld may heed the words of 50 Cent, another rapper, on racketeering charges: “Those laws were designed for you not to escape them.” </p>
