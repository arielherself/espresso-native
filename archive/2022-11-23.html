<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong>, still <strong>Brazil’s </strong>sitting president, formally challenged the result of the election that he lost to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/31/lula-will-be-brazils-next-president-now-for-the-hard-part">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> on October 30th. During his campaign Mr Bolsonaro signalled that he would refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of his own <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/win-or-lose-jair-bolsonaro-poses-a-threat-to-brazilian-democracy">possible defeat</a>. But Brazil’s courts, as well as political leaders at home and abroad, have already accepted it. Even if Mr Bolsonaro’s claim that older voting machines were untrustworthy is rejected, it might rouse his diehard supporters; it also precipitated a sharp drop in the real against the dollar.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Judges from Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that <strong>Scotland’s</strong> devolved parliament cannot pass a law calling for a referendum on independence without the approval of Britain’s government. Scotland’s first minister, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/nicola-sturgeon-on-the-push-for-another-scottish-referendum">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, argues that the result of a referendum in 2014, in which Scots rejected independence, is out of date. But the government in Westminster does not want another vote. Ms Sturgeon tweeted that such a law “makes the case” for independence. </p>

The blasts, which are the first bomb attacks on Israeli civilians since 2016 according to local police, follow months of heightened <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2021/05/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-has-claimed-14000-lives-since-1987">Israeli-Palestinian tensions</a>. </p>

Some 10m people, a quarter of the population, do not have access to power as Russian strikes have halved the country’s generating capacity.

<h3>Turkey threatens to march into Syria</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“We have been bearing down on terrorists for a few days with our planes, cannons and guns,” declared Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday. Tanks and soldiers, Turkey’s president added, would follow. Mr Erdogan has been threatening for months a military operation in northern Syria. Last year parliament extended by two years the government’s mandate to move troops into Iraq and Syria. But Mr Erdogan’s argument for a ground incursion has been growing louder since November 13th, when a bomb attack in Istanbul began a deadly tit-for-tat.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Turkey blamed the bomb on the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/06/28/what-is-the-pkk">Kurdistan Workers’ Party</a>, a rebel group fighting for Kurdish self-rule within Turkey. The group denied that claim. On Sunday Turkish rockets rained down on Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria; a retaliatory strike on Monday killed two Turkish citizens in Gaziantep, a province adjacent to Syria. Although tensions are rising, the West has been loth to restrain Mr Erdogan, who has become a helpful go-between in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<h3>Credit Suisse refills its coffers</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday Credit Suisse warned that it was expecting a loss in its fourth quarter of up to SFr1.5bn ($1.58bn) before tax. Yet another loss lends more urgency to the embattled Swiss bank’s request to shareholders, expected later in the day, to raise more capital for an ambitious restructuring plan it announced in late October. Ravaged by scandals, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/03/credit-suisse-and-the-hunt-for-the-weakest-link-in-global-finance">Credit Suisse</a> needs at least SFr4bn ($4.2bn) from investors to pad its balance-sheet. The Saudi National Bank is expected to buy a 9.9% stake, worth SFr1.5bn. That would make it the Swiss bank’s biggest shareholder.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In its new incarnation Credit Suisse plans to focus on international wealth management, as well as its domestic bank and asset-management division. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/28/investment-banks-are-sharpening-the-axe">Investment banking</a> will be radically downsized to reduce risk, with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment-banking arm of Credit Suisse, spun off. It will also let go of its securitised products business, as well as of around 9,000 of its 52,000 employees.</p>
<h3>A legal barrier to Scottish independence</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">October 19th 2023 might have been the date that Britain broke up. But that fate was averted on Wednesday by a ruling from the Supreme Court. Britain’s highest arbiter ruled that Scotland’s devolved parliament, in Edinburgh, may not pass a law calling for an independence referendum. That power, it concluded, belongs to the British parliament in Westminster alone, which the Conservative Party, which strongly opposes independence, dominates.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The ruling clears up a vital ambiguity in Britain’s constitution, and blocks the road to Scotland’s separatist government led by Nicola Sturgeon from single-handedly pursuing a break-up. It leaves the independence movement in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/03/05/the-fight-over-scottish-independence-appears-to-be-deadlocked">deadlock</a>. But the polarisation that afflicts Scottish society will continue. In a vote in 2014, held with the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2012/01/14/if-at-first-you-dont-succeed">approval</a> of David Cameron’s government, Scots rejected independence by 55% to 45%. These days they are firmly split down the middle—and today’s judgement will do little to heal that.</p>
<h3>Russia’s security club hobbles on</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/01/06/what-is-the-collective-security-treaty-organisation">Collective Security Treaty Organisation</a> (CSTO), a supposed military alliance between Russia and five ex-Soviet countries—Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan—began the year with a show of strength. In January Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan’s president, invoked the organisation’s collective-security clause to deal with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/kazakhstans-president-vows-to-cling-on-despite-nationwide-protests/21807017">anti-government protests</a>. Within hours the Russian army came to his aid. But when CSTO leaders convene in Armenia on Wednesday to discuss regional security, spirits will have dropped.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Russia, which keeps its troops in CSTO countries as part of the security pact, has been overstretched by its war in Ukraine. Family feuds have also hobbled the organisation. Last month, amid a simmering border conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, “Indestructible Brotherhood-2022” a joint military operation, was called off. In September <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/13/why-azerbaijan-and-armenia-are-fighting-again">Armenia</a> asked the organisation for weapons to fend off an attack from its bitter foe Azerbaijan, but the CSTO was able to muster only a fact-finding mission. That may be the best the club’s members can hope for.</p>
<h3>Steven Spielberg’s origin story</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">What makes a superstar film-maker? Steven Spielberg offers a moving answer in “The Fabelmans,” a thinly disguised account of his upbringing that is released across America on Wednesday. Raised by a computer-engineer father (Paul Dano) and piano-playing mother (Michelle Williams), Samuel Fabelman is left shaken after he sees the climactic train crash in Cecil B. DeMille’s “The Greatest Show on Earth” (1952). Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) spends the rest of his life trying to recreate that sense of awe by making his own moving images.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The director of “E.T.”, “Jaws” and most recently “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/01/22/west-side-story-and-the-magic-of-remakes">West Side Story</a>” is America’s best-known conjuror of cinematic fantasy; it is not easy to picture his origins in quotidian reality. But Mr Spielberg paints a detailed, emotionally intelligent portrait of his postwar Jewish suburban family—loving, yet gradually fractured by parental conflict—but avoids the amber-tinged nostalgia of much boomer-era biography. Funny and wise, the film is one by a consummate showman slowing down to reflect.</p>
