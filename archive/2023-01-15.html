<p class="customisedFont">A <strong>Russian missile </strong>flattened a nine-storey apartment block in Dnipro, in central <strong>Ukraine</strong>, killing at least 14 people and wounding 64. Russia unleashed two waves of aerial strikes on Saturday. Meanwhile Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, said that his country would send Challenger 2 <strong>main battle tanks </strong>to Ukraine. On Wednesday, Poland had promised German-made Leopard 2 <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/11/the-west-should-supply-tanks-to-ukraine">tanks</a>.

<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>Republican</strong> chairman of<strong> America’s</strong> House Oversight Committee, the investigative body of the House of Representatives, demanded to see visitor logs for <strong>President Joe Biden’s home </strong>in Delaware.

Republicans are accusing Democrats—who have insisted that Donald Trump should be prosecuted for mishandling sensitive papers—of hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Peru</strong> declared a <strong>state of emergency</strong> in Lima, the capital, and three other regions, after more than 40 people were killed during <strong>demonstrations</strong> against Dina Boluarte, the president. The country has seen violent unrest—its worst in two decades—since Pedro Castillo was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/12/07/after-a-bungled-coup-attempt-perus-president-falls">removed from the presidency</a> by Congress and arrested on December 7th for alleged corruption. Protesters are demanding his release and Ms Boluarte’s resignation.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">At least 60 people were killed when an <strong>aeroplane crashed</strong> near Pokhara, a town in central <strong>Nepal</strong>. The flight—managed by Yeti Airlines, a Nepalese company—had 68 passengers and four crew members. It is thought to be the country’s deadliest air crash since 1992. The EU has banned Nepali airlines from its airspace since 2013 because of safety concerns.</p>

<h3>America and Taiwan talk trade</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday American officials will make a rare visit to Taiwan to resume talks on trade. In some ways, this is a trade negotiation like any other. The Americans, led by Terry McCartin, an assistant trade representative, will raise familiar concerns about Taiwan’s import barriers (especially against pork and beef), labour standards and state-owned enterprises. But the geopolitical context is unique. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, is feeling diplomatically isolated. It is not a member of either of the big trade agreements in the region, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2020/11/15/the-meaning-of-rcep-the-worlds-biggest-trade-agreement">RCEP</a> (which includes China) and the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/02/19/asias-premier-trade-pact-needs-stronger-foundations">CPTPP</a> (which does not). Nor was it included in America’s new <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/06/09/what-is-the-point-of-the-indo-pacific-economic-framework">Indo-Pacific Economic Framework</a>, which aims to increase America’s commercial appeal in a part of the world falling under China’s economic spell. Taiwan thus welcomes the negotiations as a sign of America’s commitment to the island. Trade negotiations can be bruising. But Taiwan will prefer tough talks to silence.</p>
<h3>Germany weans itself off Russian gas</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Robert Habeck, the economy minister, will travel to Lubmin on the Baltic coast to open the country’s second floating terminal for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/02/26/if-the-supply-of-russian-gas-to-europe-were-cut-off-could-lng-plug-the-gap">liquefied natural gas</a> (LNG). It is another milestone in the country’s effort to reduce its consumption of Russian gas. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Until the end of last year Germany had no infrastructure to import LNG. Its other terminal opened on the North Sea coast in December. A third will soon open there too. By the end of this year Germany will have inaugurated half a dozen, providing enough import capacity to cover a third of Germany’s total gas needs. To build LNG terminals at such speed has cost the taxpayer billions of euros, but it will help ensure Germany can <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/11/the-energy-crisis-and-europes-astonishing-luck">get through the next winter</a> without gas shortages.</p>
<h3>“Big Brother” returns to Africa</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">One of the world’s best-known reality television shows returns to Africa’s screens on Sunday with a special edition called “Big Brother Titans”. Contestants from the rival continental powers of Nigeria and South Africa will be pitted against each other for the first time. And there’s $100,000 on the line.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Spin-offs of the TV franchise have been a huge success in Africa since it first aired there in 2003. Initially there was “Big Brother Africa”. DStv, a broadcaster, has often hosted channels carrying nothing but 24/7 live-streams of the houses where contestants live together and try to avoid being voted out. (The last one standing takes the cash.) Showmax, which streams DStv’s content, reported in 2020 that Big Brother Naija (Nigeria), a national version, was its most-watched livestream ever. Nigerians made up only half its viewership. As the continent-wide edition returns, there is hope that its mix of scandal, romance and high drama will again have pan-African appeal. </p>
<h3>Boiled peanuts used to treat allergies</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Between 1 and 3% of people in most countries must scrupulously avoid peanuts or risk anaphylactic shock. And the allergy’s prevalence has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2019/10/03/the-prevalence-of-peanut-allergy-has-trebled-in-15-years">tripled in the past two decades</a> in America. To help sufferers, researchers have been experimenting with exposure therapy using boiled peanuts, which washes out some of their immunoreactive proteins. (This may be why peanut allergies are less prevalent in East Asia, where people usually boil their peanuts). The latest results, published in the journal<em> Clinical &amp; Experimental Allergy</em>, are promising.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In the trial, 70 children with a peanut allergy underwent a year-long peanut training regimen. They began by eating some peanut boiled for 12 hours and escalating the dose every week. Eventually, they could nibble peanuts boiled for only two hours, and after a year most could scoff 12 roasted peanuts at a time. A slow process, but surely worth it to spare people the EpiPen or a trip to hospital. For these children at least, the label “may contain nuts” is no longer tantamount to a skull and crossbones.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: J.R. Moehringer, prince of ghostwriters</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As John Joseph (known as J.R.) Moehringer put it himself, “the midwife doesn’t go home with the baby”. Such is the lot of ghostwriters. You might expect Mr Moehringer to observe his own rule with extra rigour after he midwifed Prince Harry’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/10/prince-harrys-autobiography-is-an-ill-advised-romp">todger-and-all memoir</a>, “Spare”. Yet the furore surrounding the book has prompted Mr Moehringer to bend it, mainly by defending several inaccuracies on Twitter. Perhaps that’s because “Spare” is just as much Mr Moehringer’s work as Harry’s. From chimps to champs to princes, Mr Moehringer can find a written voice for anyone, especially if they have daddy issues (and a very large advance).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Moehringer, born in 1964 in New York City, started work as a journalist at the <em>New York Times</em>. He once inhabited the voice of Cheeta, the chimp star of the 1930s Tarzan films, to write a piece marking his 75th birthday. But Mr Moehringer’s own memoir, “The Tender Bar”, published in 2005, established his real theme: how to survive dysfunctional families. Mr Moehringer writes of his absent, “brutally insensitive” father, a rock’n’roll DJ. For male role models he had to make do with the alcohol-soaked camaraderie of uncle Charlie and his mates in a bar. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The narrative of a lost boy striving to find his true self caught the eye of Andre Agassi, a tennis star of the 1990s with an outrageous mullet. He asked Mr Moehringer to help write his own memoir. Confronted, at first, by a “stilted, resistant” Mr Agassi, Mr Moehringer unlocked his subject, much as he must have done with Harry, with some 250 hours of interviews. The process bears a close resemblance to psychoanalysis. Harry calls Mr Moehringer his “confessor” in the acknowledgments to “Spare”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Agassi’s book, “Open”, was revealing. It turned out that the Wimbledon winner hated tennis. Even the mullet was fake (to hide baldness). And, of course, there was the emotionally distant father. So, as the publishers must have realised, the Moehringer template was a perfect fit for Harry. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But what suits publishers may not have best served the prince, who might have hoped to emerge with a bit more dignity. In an age of selfies and social-media exposure, however, dignity is not going to sell books. Prince Harry chose the right ghostwriter to do that.</p>
