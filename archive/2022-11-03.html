<p class="customisedFont">Investors fretted over hawkish comments by Jerome Powell, chairman of the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>, who suggested that it would be “premature” to pause monetary tightening. Interest rates will ultimately be “higher than previously expected”, he said, shortly after America’s central bank <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/11/02/inflation-is-too-high-when-the-public-notices-it">raised its benchmark interest rate</a> by three-quarters of a percentage point, the fourth consecutive jumbo increase. The S&amp;P 500 shed 2.5% and then Asian stockmarkets fell during early trading on Thursday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea</strong> fired more missiles—including a suspected inter-continental ballistic missile—following nearly two dozen launches on Wednesday. Kishida Fumio, <strong>Japan’s </strong>prime minister, called it an “outrage” and Japanese officials issued an emergency warning to citizens living near their flight path. Earlier America accused North Korea of sending artillery shells to Russia for use in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Joe Biden </strong>declared that “American democracy is under attack” by those who refused to accept Donald Trump’s defeat in 2020. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/27/why-the-republicans-anti-democracy-turn-has-become-normalised">Most Republicans</a> competing for seats in the House, the Senate and in governors’ offices have joined Mr Trump in throwing doubt on the validity of the electoral process—in which they are expected to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/11/why-republicans-are-gaining-ground-in-midterm-polls">fare well</a>, after votes are cast and counted in next Tuesday’s <strong>midterm elections.</strong></p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia’s</strong> foreign ministry said avoiding a <strong>nuclear war</strong> was its “highest priority”, but accused the West of “encouraging provocations”. American officials had told reporters that Russian generals were discussing the use of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/10/18/how-much-damage-could-russias-tactical-nuclear-weapons-do">tactical nukes</a> in Ukraine. Separately, Russia rejoined a deal allowing <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/28/will-the-grain-deal-between-russia-and-ukraine-reduce-global-hunger">exports of grain</a> to leave Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. It said it had received “written guarantees” over the safety of Russian vessels.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ethiopia’s</strong> government and leaders from <strong>Tigray</strong>, its rebellious northern region, agreed to an immediate <strong>ceasefire</strong> in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/ethiopias-peace-talks-may-be-overtaken-by-battlefield-advances">peace talks</a> brokered by the African Union. Representatives from Tigray said they had made unspecified “concessions”. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/02/a-fragile-ceasefire-offers-hope-in-ethiopia">previous truce</a> struck in March lasted five months.

With 90% of votes counted from Tuesday’s election, Mr Netanyahu’s religious and right-wing coalition is on track to gain 62-65 of 120 seats in parliament. Another winner was Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right nationalist whose faction doubled its number of seats and whom Mr Netanyahu will need to form a government. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s two largest <strong>pharmacies </strong>tentatively agreed to pay more than $10bn to settle claims brought by state, local and tribal governments accusing the retailers of inappropriately filling <strong>opioid</strong> prescriptions.

<h3>Scholz’s China strategy</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday Germany’s chancellor will visit Beijing. China is Germany’s largest trading partner and Olaf Scholz is the first Western leader to visit the Chinese capital since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. The symbolism is huge, but not as straightforward as it seems. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">After he was elected in 2021 Mr Scholz committed in his coalition agreement to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/16/germany-is-recalibrating-its-close-economic-ties-with-china">recalibrating</a> Germany’s close economic ties with China by better defending German interests and monitoring China’s human-rights record. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting energy crisis, highlighted the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/20/russia-was-more-deeply-embedded-in-german-politics-than-suspected">dangers</a> of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/11/thanks-to-vladimir-putin-germany-has-woken-up">economic dependence</a> on an autocracy. Yet China matters much more than Russia to German business.<br/><br/> Mr Scholz is travelling with a dozen chief executives of German blue-chip companies, who want to produce more in China or buy more critical minerals to make cars. And he recently agreed to a controversial sale of a stake in a container terminal in Hamburg to a Chinese state-run shipping company. Less an assertive new Scholz strategy this signals a continuation of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2020/07/16/angela-merkels-soft-china-stance-is-challenged-at-home">soft stance on China</a> of Angela Merkel, his predecessor.</p>
<h3>The Bank of England’s interest-rate decision</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Investors expect Britain’s monetary policymakers to lift the official interest rate by 0.75 percentage points on Thursday, to 3%. That would be the sharpest increase in over three decades, and will tug mortgage rates higher and general demand lower. To justify the move, policymakers will point to the risk that uncomfortably high annual inflation in September of 10.1% becomes entrenched.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Bank of England’s choice will not be easy. One prime minister, Liz Truss,<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/11/liz-truss-has-made-britain-a-riskier-bet-for-bond-investors"> spooked markets</a> with promises of tax cuts. Now a new one,<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/27/rishi-sunak-britains-new-prime-minister-starts-on-the-defensive"> Rishi Sunak</a>, is planning <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/20/as-britains-government-looks-to-save-money-almost-nothing-is-protected">the opposite</a>.<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/20/as-britains-government-looks-to-save-money-almost-nothing-is-protected"></a>Details of those plans are due on November 17th, casting a fog over the fiscal outlook. It may take longer to find out what help households will get with energy bills beyond April. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">It is unclear yet whether inflation associated with higher energy prices will prove persistent or whether higher costs will sap demand and lower prices. Amid that uncertainty, taming inflation without kicking the economy too hard will prove exceptionally tricky.</p>
<h3>Donald Trump in Iowa</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Historically, Iowa was one of America’s swing states, but these days it is reliably red. Nevertheless Donald Trump, a former president, will be in Sioux City on Thursday hosting a rally with Chuck Grassley, the state’s 89-year-old Republican senator, and Kim Reynolds, the Republican governor, ahead of the midterms on November 8th.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Although Mr Grassley is facing a tighter race than at any point in his 42 years in the Senate, few truly believe his Democratic opponent, Mike Franken, has much of a chance. Ms Reynolds is also solidly ahead. So Mr Trump, who rarely does anything that he does not think will benefit him, may have another reason for visiting the Hawkeye state.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Asked in October about running for president, Mr Trump said he will “probably have to do it again.” Iowa votes for its preferred presidential candidates before any other state. In 2016, Mr Trump came second in a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2016/02/04/trump-bumped">crowded field</a>, propelling him up the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2016/05/26/donald-trump-gets-the-1237-delegates-he-needs-for-the-republican-nomination">GOP ticket</a>. Could he be laying the groundwork for 2024?</p>
<h3>Lula’s choice for Petrobras</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Brazil’s state-run oil giant, Petrobras, will publish its earnings for the third quarter on Thursday. Expect robust cashflow and payouts to investors. Nevertheless, the current quarter will be the last for Caio Mário Paes de Andrade, chief executive since June.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Brazil’s largest company has been a political instrument since its foundation in the 1950s. Jair Bolsonaro, who lost the presidential election on October 30th, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2021/02/27/why-the-sacking-of-petrobrass-boss-spooked-markets">fired</a> three Petrobras bosses during his four-year tenure. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/31/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-be-brazils-next-president">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a>, who will take office in January, will name his new team soon, including a boss for Petrobras.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Lula’s relationship with Petrobras will be closely watched for repeats of mistakes made in his previous terms, between 2003 and 2010. In 2014 Petrobras was found to be at the heart of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/americas-view/2014/09/08/the-petrobras-affair">corruption scheme</a> uncovered during the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/04/30/two-law-enforcement-officials-reflect-on-a-brazilian-corruption-scandal">Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation</a>. Eight Petrobras directors were convicted. Lula’s involvement earned him a 12-year sentence of which he spent a year and a half <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2018/04/08/lula-goes-to-jail">in jail</a> (although his convictions were later annulled). He must make his appointment carefully.</p>
<h3>David Hockney continues to bloom</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On his first day at the Royal College of Art, in London, in 1959, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2019/02/28/smoking-with-david-hockney">David Hockney</a> drew a skeleton. His draughtsmanship so impressed another student—the American painter R.B. Kitaj—that he offered Mr Hockney £5 (then $14) for it. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Some sixty years on, Mr Hockney’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2017/02/14/david-hockneys-road-to-renewal">talent is undimmed</a>, though he now uses an iPad instead of pencil and paper. The artist who made California’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2017/02/14/the-tate-dives-into-the-art-of-david-hockney">swimming pools</a> famous (one of his pool pictures sold for $90m in 2018, making it the most expensive painting ever sold at auction by a living artist) now lives in France, where he mostly paints nature. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Four concurrent exhibitions of his work, entitled “20 Flowers and Some Bigger Pictures”, open this month in Chicago, London, Los Angeles and Paris—with a fifth joining later in New York. Each show contains nearly 30 iPad works, both individual digital paintings and composite pictures with multiple screens, that explore hillsides, flowers and shadows. The artist calls them “new looking fresh pictures of a very beautiful world”.</p>
