<p class="customisedFont">Buckingham Palace announced the death of <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> at the age of 96. The palace said that the queen had died peacefully at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Elizabeth was Britain’s oldest and longest-reigning monarch. She was crowned on June 2nd 1953 and led Britain, and the Commonwealth, through a period of intense change. Prince Philip, the Queen’s husband of 73 years, died in April 2021. Her eldest son, Charles, the Prince of Wales, has succeeded her.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> raised <strong>interest rates</strong> by 0.75 percentage points for the first time on record, in an effort to curb soaring prices.

The default tariff rate that most pay will be capped at £2,500 ($1,730) for two years, saving an average household about £1,000 a year compared with expected costs. Businesses will be supported for six months. Ms Truss claimed that her scheme would curb inflation by up to 5%.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, America’s ambassador to the UN, said Russia’s actions amounted to a war crime and called for a UN investigation. Russia denied the allegations. Earlier, Russia’s ruling party proposed holding referendums on the status of occupied Ukrainian territories on November 4th. Russia used a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2014/03/15/a-predictable-outcome">vote</a> in occupied Crimea in 2014 to justify the peninsula’s annexation.</p>

<h3>The ECB raises interest rates</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As private forecasters such as Oxford Economics downgrade Europe’s economic outlook to “recession”, the European Central Bank increased its main rates by 0.75 percentage points on Thursday. The reason is that consumer-price inflation is very high: the latest figure, for August, was 9.1% compared with a year earlier—way above the bank’s target of 2%. And the ECB said it expects to raise rates further. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Is it the right call to increase interest rates at the beginning of a potential recession? After all, inflation in Europe is not the outcome of a booming economy, but mostly the result of exorbitant energy prices. These are starting to eat so deeply into consumers’ pockets and businesses’ tills that the economy is weakening fast on its own, even without the added burden of the ECB’s rate hikes. After underestimating the threat of inflation over the past year, the bank may now be underestimating the chances of a downturn.</p>
<h3>​​Macron’s new democratic wheeze</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The French president launches his latest brainchild on Thursday. The idea behind Emmanuel Macron’s <em>Conseil National de la Refondation </em>(roughly, national refoundation council) is to bring together politicians, unions, NGOs, business leaders and others to discuss solutions to big challenges including climate change and energy, employment, education and health. The council is designed to revive democratic participation after low turnout at presidential and parliamentary elections this year. It is also a riposte to those who accuse Mr Macron of excessive top-down rule and of not listening.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A heavyweight government team will attend the opening day in Marcoussis, a town near Paris. Sessions will be held in different settings across France for several months. Yet already all national <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/30/fresh-faces-on-the-far-right-and-left-fill-frances-parliament">opposition parties</a>, and most unions, have boycotted the council, dismissing it as merely a talking shop. By <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/19/emmanuel-macron-loses-his-parliamentary-majority">denying</a> Mr Macron a majority at parliamentary elections in June, French voters sent a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/22/what-president-emmanuel-macron-should-learn-from-losing-his-majority-in-the-french-parliament">clear message</a> that they want more collaborative rule. So far, opposition politicians seem wedded to the old confrontational culture.</p>
<h3>Two ways of counting in Thai</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When Prayuth Chan-ocha, then head of Thailand’s army, staged a coup to overthrow an elected government in May 2014, few thought he would dominate politics for long. Yet on Thursday the country’s constitutional court heard arguments about how an eight-year term limit for prime ministers, codified in the constitution of 2017, might apply to Mr Prayuth.<br/><br/> The opposition argues that the prime minister’s time ran out last month. The same court suspended him from official duties on August 24th. But “Uncle Tu” argues that only the years after 2019, when his pro-army, royalist coalition won a majority in a general election, should count.<br/><br/> The pro-establishment court decided it needs to hear more evidence, and proposed to reconvene on September 14th. If it then decides in Mr Prayuth’s favour it would trigger anti-government protests, particularly among students. Economic troubles are already fanning discontent. Pheu Thai, the main opposition party, is eyeing a landslide in an election due next year, even after a change in the voting system. But in an autocracy built under the veil of democracy, it would be a miracle if Thais were soon allowed to get the government they actually want.</p>
<h3>Building back better in Beirut</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Beirut is no stranger to a rebuild. In its tumultuous 5,000-year history the city has had to revamp itself seven times, most recently after the civil war, which ended in 1990, and a conflict with Israel in 2006. Government <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/04/beirut-marks-an-awful-anniversary-with-more-disaster">negligence</a> led to a huge blast that ravaged its port in 2020, killing over 200 people. The capital of Lebanon is now facing yet another reconstruction. But this time the wider world has had the chance to offer ideas. On Thursday Inspireli Awards, a Czech architecture firm, will announce the winners of its Beirut Port Renewal Competition. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Judges will choose from 40 plans, from 19 countries, featuring outdoor theatres, museums, vast transport links and urban farms. The winning architects will collaborate with the port administration and the Lebanese government to hone their plans. The next test will be finding the money to pay for it all. It is an opportunity to reshape the future of a city, hopefully for good this time.</p>
<h3>Pinocchio is having his moment</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In “Pinocchio”, released on Disney+ and in some cinemas on Thursday, Tom Hanks stars as Geppetto, a lonely Italian toymaker who carves a puppet that becomes a “real boy”. But Robert Zemeckis’s live-action remake of the classic animation, originally released by Disney in 1940, has company. Recent films bringing Pinocchio to life include Matteo Garrone’s drama from 2019 and “Pinocchio: A True Story”, a Russian version released earlier this year. Guillermo del Toro’s much-awaited stop-action version, using models, is expected to find its feet on Netflix in December.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">What is behind this marionette mania? Perhaps the rise of AI, since Pinocchio is, after all, a kind of robot who runs amok. Or does his nose-extending mendacity strike a chord in an age of fake news? In Carlo Collodi’s “The Adventures of Pinocchio”, published in 1883, the nose-growing plays a surprisingly minor role. But the book’s most important message is just as relevant today: it is only by caring for others that we become fully human.</p>
