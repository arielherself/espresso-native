<p class="customisedFont">American stockmarkets jumped after <strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, the chairman of the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>, said that “the time for moderating the pace of rate increases” was imminent. The S&amp;P 500 leapt by 3% at his suggestion that interest rates would rise by only half a percentage point in December, following <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done">four straight increases</a> of three-quarters of a point, and the Dow exited bear territory. Asian currencies leapt too, on the prospect of the dollar losing ground.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Chongqing and Guangzhou, two of <strong>China’s </strong>biggest cities, said that they would ease their stringent <strong>covid-19 restrictions</strong>, amid the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows">widespread protests</a> they set off. At the same time Beijing recorded more than 5,000 new cases, a record. Meanwhile, <strong>Jiang Zemin</strong>, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/11/30/jiang-zemin-oversaw-a-wave-of-economic-change-but-not-much-political-reform">former president</a> who presided over a wave of economic change, died at the age of 96.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">An independent panel appointed by the speaker of<strong> South Africa’s </strong>parliament determined that the president, <strong>Cyril Ramaphosa</strong>, probably <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/06/23/allegations-of-impropriety-weaken-south-africas-president">violated anti-corruption laws</a>, raising the likelihood that he will be impeached. Mr Ramaphosa stands accused of covering up the theft of at least $4m from his cattle farm in 2020. He denies the accusations.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The regular shipment of <strong>ammonia </strong>from <strong>Russia </strong>to ports on the Black Sea via Ukraine should be restored soon, according to Martin Griffiths, the UN’s emergency-aid co-ordinator. He said an agreement, like the warring countries’ <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/28/will-the-grain-deal-between-russia-and-ukraine-reduce-global-hunger">grain-export deal</a>, might be reached this week. Ammonia is used to produce <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/05/31/why-fertiliser-prices-are-soaring">fertiliser</a> around the world, making it “hugely important, almost more important than grain”.</p>

The Senate is expected to follow suit.

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Football World Cup: Australia</strong> shocked <strong>Denmark</strong> to secure a place in the knockout round for only the second time in the team’s history.

The Poles squeezed through as well, pipping Mexico on goal difference.</p>

<h3>A tense trip to China for a top Eurocrat</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, will meet Xi Jinping, China’s president, in Beijing on Thursday. After years of pandemic-imposed isolation, China is keen to reset its chilly relationship with Europe. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was invited to visit in November, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected early next year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the timing for Mr Michel, who chairs summits of EU leaders, is especially tricky. In the past week <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows">demonstrations</a> against draconian covid restrictions have gripped China. Police are intimidating and detaining protesters. Mr Michel is under pressure to comment, but must choose his words carefully—China needs little excuse to blame “foreign forces” for inciting domestic unrest.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine will also be on the agenda. Mr Michel and other European leaders want Mr Xi to put pressure on Russia to end its invasion. The chances of success seem slim, though: Chinese officials recently cancelled a video address by Mr Michel to a trade expo in Shanghai when they learned he would be criticising the war. </p>
<h3>Spain sets its sights on startups</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Spain is not the easiest place to do business. It has good infrastructure and little petty corruption. But its legal traditions—in which it can seem as if everything not expressly permitted is forbidden—and unwieldy bureaucracy can make starting and growing a company harder than it should be.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The government hopes that a new law will change that, at least for startups. The bill, which should pass through the lower house of parliament on Thursday, aims to lighten the load for founders by offering lower taxes, more favourable tax treatment for stock options and other benefits for companies that are less than five years old and that generate less than €10m ($10m) in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The law should make life easier for “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2021/10/02/why-europe-is-a-great-place-for-digital-nomads">digital nomads</a>” who fancy a move to Spain, too. Non-EU nationals will be able to apply for a simplified visa and pay a lower rate of tax while working remotely from the country, provided that their paying clients are mainly based abroad. </p>
<h3>A challenge to India’s opposition in Gujarat</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday voters head to the polls to elect a local government in Gujarat, a state of 70m people in western India. The result is practically guaranteed. The Bharatiya Janata Party—which also rules the country—has won the last six elections in Gujarat. Still, the party is not taking any chances. Narendra Modi, the BJP prime minister who rose to national prominence as Gujarat’s leader, has attended dozens of rallies in the run-up to the election.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But watch the battle for second place. That spot has usually gone to Congress, India’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/11/27/narendra-modis-secret-weapon-a-useless-opposition">hapless national opposition party</a>. But this time it faces competition from Aam Aadmi Party, a newish populist group. The AAP recently beat the BJP and Congress in elections in Punjab, a northern state. In Gujarat it is running on a similar campaign, promising free education and electricity. Another strong showing would establish the AAP as a national force, and perhaps the strongest challenger to the BJP ahead of India’s next general election in 2024.</p>
<h3>The soaring global cost of living</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">New York and Singapore are the world’s most expensive cities, according to the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from EIU, <em>The Economist’s</em> sister company. The survey, which compares the prices of more than 200 products and services in 173 cities, finds that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/08/global-living-standards-are-moving-in-the-wrong-direction">living costs</a> are rising at their fastest clip for at least 20 years. Prices in major cities are up by an average of 8.1%, in local-currency terms, over the past year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Russia’s war in Ukraine is one cause, leading to higher food and energy prices. Supply-chain problems caused by covid-19 restrictions in China are another. Though six of the top ten cities that have moved the most up the rankings are in America, the two biggest climbers are Russian. Western sanctions have driven up prices such that St Petersburg has risen 70 places since 2021, while Moscow has shot up 88 slots, to 37th place.</p>
<h3>A Beckmann self-portrait goes under the hammer</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Last year 80% of international art sales took place in America, Britain, China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. Germany, by contrast, does not have a reputation as an art-sales hotspot. But one lot on Thursday at Grisebach, one of the leading auction houses in Berlin, will command attention around the world.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Among the pieces going under the hammer is “Selbstbildnis gelb-rosa”—“Self-Portrait Yellow-Pink”—by Max Beckmann, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2019/03/14/talent-and-tragedy-">German Expressionist</a>. The painting is expected to go for between €20m-€30m ($21m-$31m), which would make it the priciest piece ever sold at auction in Germany.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Beckmann painted the self-portrait as a gift for his wife, Mathilde, in 1943, after the pair fled Nazi Germany (Beckmann had been declared a “cultural Bolshevik” by the regime). It has been privately owned until now. Painted in unusually bright colours, it offers a glimpse of the artist’s strong spirit in the face of war and exile. </p>
