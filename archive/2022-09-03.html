<p class="customisedFont">Thousands of Russians paid their respects to <strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/31/mikhail-gorbachev-liberated-millions-even-if-he-didnt-set-out-to">last leader</a> of the Soviet Union, at his funeral on Saturday. The ceremony, which the Kremlin offered only “elements” of a state funeral, was accompanied by heavy security. Gorbachev is hailed as a reformist hero by many liberal Russians. But Vladimir Putin has blamed him for allowing the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/08/30/mikhail-gorbachev-did-not-mean-the-soviet-union-to-end-that-way">USSR’s dissolution</a>. Mr Putin did not attend the funeral, citing scheduling conflicts.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> agreed to sell military equipment worth $1.1bn to <strong>Taiwan</strong>. The package includes anti-ship missiles and a radar warning system. A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington warned that China would “resolutely take legitimate and necessary counter-measures” in response. The sale comes days after<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/09/01/american-warships-go-through-the-taiwan-strait"> American warships passed through the Taiwan Strait</a> without incident.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>NASA</strong> will try to launch its<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/08/24/nasas-space-launch-system-is-yesterdays-rocket"> Moon rocket</a> for the second time on Saturday, after the first attempt was aborted because of an engine glitch. America’s space agency hopes to send an unmanned capsule on an orbit around the Moon. The Artemis programme, which costs<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/28/nasas-newest-rocket-is-a-colossal-waste-of-money"> billions of dollars</a>, aims to send humans to the Moon by 2025.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Gazprom</strong>, a Russian energy firm, said it would keep the <strong>Nord Stream 1</strong> (NS1) undersea gas pipeline shut beyond a three-day closure that was due to end on Saturday. It blamed a leak in a turbine, and gave no indication when it would restart <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter">deliveries</a>. European officials cried foul. On Saturday Russian gas flows to Europe via an overland pipeline were slightly higher than a day earlier—but not by enough to make up for the missing NS1 deliveries.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Gazprom’s announcement came shortly after ministers from the <strong>G7</strong> group of big economies backed a proposal to <strong>cap the price</strong> of Russian oil. Under the plan firms would be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/24/western-sanctions-will-eventually-impair-russias-economy">barred</a> from financing or insuring shipments of Russian oil if the sale price exceeds the cap. The level of the cap has not yet been set, but it will take effect on December 5th.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Much of <strong>Shenzhen</strong>, a Chinese tech metropolis, entered a weekend lockdown to allow for mass covid-19 testing, as the city battles a spike in cases. Residents of six districts were told to halt “unnecessary movement and activities”; public transport and restaurant dining were suspended. One person from each household will be permitted to leave their homes to purchase necessities. Shenzhen is the latest Chinese megacity to face severe constraints: 21m residents of Chengdu, in southwest China, entered lockdown on Thursday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The 27-year career of <strong>Serena Williams</strong>, widely considered the greatest female tennis player in history, may have come to an end. After losing to Ajla Tomljanovic in the third round of the US Open, Ms Williams received a standing ovation from a crowd of almost 24,000. The tournament is thought to be her last; when asked if she might reconsider leaving tennis, Ms Williams answered, &quot;I don&#x27;t think so, but you never know.&quot;</p>

<h3>Vying for the Keystone State</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Pennsylvania’s midterm elections carry high stakes. Democrats have a rare chance to flip a Senate seat. Republicans are set to restrict abortion if they win the governor’s office. Underlining the state’s importance, President Joe Biden will have travelled there three times in a week come Monday. Not to be outdone, on Saturday Donald Trump will hold a rally near Mr Biden’s hometown of Scranton.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Endorsed by Mr Trump, the Republican candidates look <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/24/donald-trumps-endorsements-are-reshaping-the-republican-party">like liabilities</a>. Mehmet Oz, a celebrity television doctor running for the Senate, has been roasted for an out-of-touch ad lamenting that inflation had made crudités unaffordable. Doug Mastriano, a hard-right state legislator vying for the governorship, peddles the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. He says he will make voters re-register, to crack down on (non-existent) widespread fraud, a proposition that conflicts with federal law. The two candidates won over Mr Trump. Polls suggest they are struggling to do the same with Pennsylvanians. </p>
<h3>The European energy rollercoaster</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Over the past two weeks energy traders have watched in disbelief as European gas and electricity markets <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/01/europe-scrambles-to-protect-consumers-against-dizzying-energy-prices">exploded</a>. Gas futures for the fourth quarter of 2022 briefly touched €350 ($350) per megawatt-hour (the typical pre-pandemic price was around €30). French daytime power—particularly expensive because demand is highest during the day—hit more than €2,500. For comparison, the running costs of a nuclear plant, of which France has many although most are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/28/frances-nuclear-plants-are-going-down-for-repairs">closed for maintenance</a>, are about €30 per MWh. The price bubble deflated, but settled at still-alarming levels, of €250 per MWh for gas and €1,750 for French daytime power. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Where next for European energy prices? Germany’s decision on whether to keep its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/01/08/why-germans-remain-so-jittery-about-nuclear-power">remaining three nuclear plants</a> open beyond December is due soon, and France is working on restarting more of its plants. Luckily Russia’s closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on August 31st, supposedly for maintenance, barely moved markets. The impact of Russia’s attempts at energy blackmail may be weakening. </p>
<h3>Mikhail Gorbachev’s divided legacy</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In the West Mikhail Gorbachev, who <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/08/30/mikhail-gorbachev-did-not-mean-the-soviet-union-to-end-that-way">died this week</a>, is heralded as an <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/31/mikhail-gorbachev-liberated-millions-even-if-he-didnt-set-out-to">idealistic reformer</a>. But elsewhere the Soviet Union’s final leader was less esteemed. Many Russians blame him for the economic and social chaos that followed the Soviet Union’s collapse. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, pointedly skipped his funeral on Saturday, which had only “elements” of a state ceremony. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In other ex-Soviet states Mr Gorbachev is a controversial figure. After supporting Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, he was banned from Ukraine for five years. The nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, in northern Ukraine, occurred a year into his tenure as general secretary; its scars still run deep. Under his watch hundreds of pro-independence protesters were killed in crackdowns in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Lithuania. The latter’s foreign minister says he “will not glorify” the Soviet leader. Mr Gorbachev’s reforms helped lift the Iron Curtain; his death shows how differently eastern and western Europe remember him. </p>
<h3>Seoul’s art scene fairs well</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">One of the world’s biggest and trendiest art events opened to the public on Saturday in South Korea’s capital. VIPs in Seoul got a special viewing of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/09/01/one-of-the-worlds-most-important-art-fairs-comes-to-south-korea">Frieze’s first Asian fair</a> on Friday night. Talk of new exhibitions and agents’ percentages filled the air as gallerists, critics and collectors chatted and struck deals in Korean, English, Italian and Mandarin. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Frieze’s arrival in South Korea is something of a coming-out party. Seoul’s reputation in the art world has been steadily growing; foreign galleries have arrived and young local enthusiasts have been buying lots of art. The fair will also test Seoul’s ability to rival Hong Kong as an Asian centre of the art world. Over the past 30 years South Korea’s star has risen dramatically. But with only 2% of global sales of post-war art, it still has some way to go. </p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Liz Truss, Britain’s likely next prime minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">If Rishi Sunak becomes <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/07/21/the-choice-between-rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss">leader of the Conservative Party</a> on September 5th, it will be the greatest upset for the political polling industry since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton to win the American presidency in 2016. At present Liz Truss appears overwhelmingly likely to win the poll of Conservative members and succeed Boris Johnson as the party’s leader—and with it become <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/18/what-kind-of-prime-minister-will-britain-get">Britain’s prime minister</a>. Betting markets imply she has a 95% chance of prevailing. Who is she?</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Truss is one of the most experienced members of the British government. First elected in 2010, she joined the cabinet as agriculture secretary in 2014 under David Cameron. She continued at the top table under Mr Cameron’s successors, holding the posts of justice secretary, chief secretary to the Treasury, trade secretary and most recently foreign secretary.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">She has adopted the mantle of her hero, Margaret Thatcher. Her overriding priority is improving Britain’s low productivity through a combination of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/18/parsing-the-policies-of-liz-truss-and-rishi-sunak">tax cuts and regulatory reform</a>. She plans to cut payroll taxes and cancel a planned raise in corporation tax. Ms Truss brushes aside warnings that fiscal loosening would be inflationary. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">A large part of her appeal to Tory members is a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2021/04/08/liz-truss-and-the-power-of-perkiness">relentless optimism</a>. And also a loyalty to Mr Johnson who, despite being ousted by his colleagues in July after two scandal-plagued years, retains the affection of rank-and-file party members—not least for delivering Brexit. She is a forceful advocate of a new doctrine of muscular cultural conservatism in the modern Tory party: pro free speech, against revisionist historians and new gender theories.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Truss’s critics regard her as an oddity and a lightweight, not least for her invocations of Thatcher’s legacy. She is best known outside of Westminster for a gawky speech delivered as agricultural secretary, pledging to open up “pork markets”. Yet she has been repeatedly underestimated—including by Mr Sunak. </p>
