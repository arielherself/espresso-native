<p class="customisedFont">In his first public statement since <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/31/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-be-brazils-next-president">losing Brazil’s presidential election</a>, <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> made no mention of his defeat to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, though afterwards an aide said he would comply with the transfer of power. Mr Bolsonaro said those protesting in his support were expressing “injustice” about the vote. But he made no allegations of voter fraud and instructed his supporters to avoid “invading property”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia </strong>broadened its “evacuation” of occupied southern Ukraine. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed leader of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter">Kherson</a> region, told 70,000 people living within 15km of the eastern bank of the Dnieper river to flee. The Ukrainian government says the evacuations represent the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/07/russia-is-disappearing-vast-numbers-of-ukrainians">forced deportation</a> of its citizens. Russia claims that Ukraine is planning to flood parts of Kherson by destroying a dam. Meanwhile, Russian missile attacks continued across Ukraine, with at least one civilian dying in Mykolaiv, a city in the south.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Israelis</strong> headed to the polls for the fifth time since 2019. The race for control of the Knesset is neck-and-neck between right-wing parties supporting <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/27/binyamin-netanyahus-memoir-is-a-fascinating-study-of-power">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>’s return <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/israels-binyamin-netanyahu-bids-for-an-election-comeback">as prime minister</a> and centrist and left-wing parties who do not.

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong>, now the CEO of <strong>Twitter</strong>, which <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">he bought</a> for $44bn last week, dissolved the social-media company’s board—making himself its sole director. It was reported that he intends to start charging the site’s verified “blue-tick” users $20 a month. Mr Musk had already alarmed Twitterati by tweeting (then deleting) a link to a conspiracy theory about <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/30/the-attack-at-the-pelosis-home-was-part-of-a-dangerous-pattern">an attack at the home of Nancy Pelosi</a>, the Speaker of America’s House of Representatives.</p>

<h3>What Lula’s win means for Brazil</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/31/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-be-brazils-next-president">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> will lead Brazil again after winning the country’s fiercest contest since it returned to democratic elections in 1989. Mr Lula, of the leftist Workers’ Party, will return as president—he previously served two terms between 2003 and 2010—after narrowly beating the right-wing populist incumbent,<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/10/15/the-enduring-threat-of-jair-bolsonaro"> Jair Bolsonaro</a>, in Sunday’s election. Lula won 50.9% to Mr Bolsonaro’s 49.1%, a margin of just over 2m votes. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">After a campaign marked by violence and fake news, Lula must pacify a fractured country. “I will govern for 215m Brazilians, not just for those who voted for me”, he said in his victory speech. But Mr Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly cast doubt on the electoral system, may not accept defeat. Depending on his reaction <em>b</em><em>olsonaristas </em>may resort to street violence. Lula hopes to boost spending to alleviate poverty. Mr Bolsonaro’s allies in congress, though, may block <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/20/brazils-next-president-will-face-a-big-tricky-in-tray">his agenda</a>. Lula will find governing much harder this time around.</p>
<h3>Another election in Israel</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday Israel is holding its fifth parliamentary election in less than four years. Yet again, the campaigns centre around whether <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/27/binyamin-netanyahus-memoir-is-a-fascinating-study-of-power">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>, the former prime minister who was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2021/06/13/naftali-bennett-pushes-binyamin-netanyahu-out-of-power-in-israel">forced out</a> amid a myriad of scandals in 2021 and is now leader of the opposition, should <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/israels-binyamin-netanyahu-bids-for-an-election-comeback">return to office</a>. Israelis are split on the issue. Right-wing and religious parties supporting Mr Netanyahu are forecast to win 60 seats in the 120-member Knesset. The rest will go to centrist and left-wing parties opposed to his return.<br/><br/> Under Israel’s proportional-representation system, no single party has ever won an outright majority in the Knesset. A stable government is far from assured. If Mr Netanyahu’s bloc wins a majority he will be beholden to far-right ultra-nationalist parties. If Mr Netanyahu fails, the incumbent prime minister, Yair Lapid, will be stuck with a coalition of squabbling parties which last time collapsed after only a year. Yet another trip to the ballot box seems likely.</p>
<h3>The bad business models of digital darlings</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Uber’s share price rose by more than a tenth on Tuesday after it reported that quarterly revenues grew by 72% year over year, to $8.3bn. Still, the ride-sharing firm again incurred a net loss, this time of $1.2bn. Uber’s problems are not unique. After a multi-year bull run, and despite Uber’s share-price “pop” on Tuesday, American technology stocks are suffering a sharp correction. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has fallen by almost 30% in the past 12 months. Crunchbase, a data provider, estimates that tech firms have shed more than 45,000 jobs this year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Some of those born after the dotcom crash of 2001 seem particularly vulnerable. They include “movers” (<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/uber-doordash-and-similar-firms-cant-defy-the-laws-of-capitalism-after-all/21806198">like Uber</a>), “streamers” (like Netflix), and “creepers” (like Snap, which make their money by serving targeted ads), which have all seen their share performances decline. These businesses, though diverse, have made similar mistakes, including an overestimation of the value of users and an underestimation of the risk of copy-cats. Despite what tech-enthusiasts once believed, the harsh laws of competitive capitalism still apply online.</p>
<h3>The Arab League meets</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“Sorry, something went wrong,” reads an apology on the homepage of the Arab League’s duff website. Many of its 22 member-states would agree. The group’s first summit for three years opens on Tuesday in Algiers, Algeria’s capital, but the leaders of most of the Gulf states, Morocco and<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/26/syrias-outcast-dictator-returns-to-the-arab-world"> Syria</a> (which was suspended in 2011) are staying away. Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, cried off, citing an earache. And<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/28/lebanon-goes-to-the-polls-amid-its-worst-ever-financial-crisis"> Lebanon</a> has no leader to send after its president stepped down on October 30th. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Unlike other regional bodies, the League has no common market or currency, and no peace-keeping force. It also has little consensus. Arab leaders disagree on<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/a-change-in-iran-could-reshape-the-middle-east"> Iran</a>, Libya, disputed<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/26/morocco-scents-victory-in-western-sahara"> Western Sahara</a> and<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/22/trade-and-security-ties-are-knitting-israel-into-its-region"> relations with Israel and Palestine</a>. To find some common ground the League’s chairman, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, has suggested a focus on food security and other issues caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. But even that leads to rancour. While energy producers celebrate booming economies caused by high prices, consumer countries are crashing into recession. More beleaguered than League, perhaps.</p>
<h3>George Balanchine’s life and art</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The life of George Balanchine, an influential ballet choreographer, was a journey across the political and cultural landscape of the 20th century. Born in St Petersburg in 1904 Balanchine came of age during an era of revolution. He fled west, first to Berlin, then Paris and eventually America. In 1934 he helped to set up the School of American Ballet and in 1948 he co-founded the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2015/04/10/something-old-something-new">New York City Ballet</a>. “Mr B”, a new biography by Jennifer Homans, is a portrait of a fascinating man and of the art to which he dedicated his career.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Homans explores both the technical details of Balanchine’s craft and the messy details of his personal life. For Balanchine, dance was inextricably bound up with love and sex. He was a difficult boss: generous, but petty and tyrannical. Ms Homans does not shy away from the darker side of his character, but is willing to forgive him for the sake of his genius.</p>
