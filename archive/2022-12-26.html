The leading health authority then declared that it would cease publishing any covid-related figures—leaving that to a lesser-ranking body which acknowledged no covid deaths in the six days through Sunday, despite reports of overwhelmed morgues.

<h3>2023 in preview: How might the war in Ukraine play out?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping Europe?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">As 2022 draws to a close, Ukraine is still an independent state—something few may have predicted when <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis">Russia invaded it</a> in February. Three broad scenarios now seem plausible for next year. The first, and worst, assumes that Russia stabilises the front lines and rebuilds its battalions. Supplies and arms from America and Europe could dwindle. Western countries might then lobby Ukraine to accept a ceasefire. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The second, and far more likely, is a stalemate. Russia might mobilise enough young men to fill trenches and man fortifications, without training them to be the effective fighters needed for victory. Unwilling to concede, President Vladimir Putin might simply try to exhaust Ukraine and its allies. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The third is the most encouraging, and possibly the most dangerous. Ukraine, maintaining its current momentum, could bring its forces to the cusp of Crimea. Mr Putin might then issue an ultimatum: stop or risk the use of nuclear weapons. The world will hold its breath.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: Inflation will be tough for Europe</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping Europe?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2023 the full economic impact of price rises—and the energy crunch largely responsible for them—will be felt across Europe. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023">recession</a> is coming, followed by a painfully slow recovery. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Though Europe added to its capacity to import liquefied natural gas after Russia slashed sales, global LNG supplies will not increase by much in 2023. That means energy will remain expensive, and it will keep prices high across the rest of the economy. Hard-hit consumers and businesses will start to hold back, curbing both spending and investment.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Europe’s shortage of workers will get worse, which will hurt firms but keep unemployment low. But unlike in previous slumps, the global economy will not come to Europe’s rescue: it is currently suffering much the same malaise. Only once energy prices have fallen and inflation in America has been contained will global growth be able to support Europe’s recovery. That will come, but not in 2023.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: Britons expect more civil disorder</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping Europe?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">Barring sectarian scuffles in Northern Ireland, Britain has experienced relatively little civil disorder in the past ten years. That peaceful run will probably end in 2023—though not necessarily for the most obvious reason.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The soaring cost of energy and food <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/23/a-wave-of-unrest-is-coming-heres-how-to-avert-some-of-it">seems dangerous</a>, but bad behaviour does not always follow bad economic times. People are more likely to riot because they feel the authorities are behaving intolerably, and because they think they can get away with it. Both conditions now apply in Blighty. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In London, the epicentre of most British disorder, attitudes to the police have deteriorated in recent years: in March 2022 57% of Londoners described the force as reliable, compared with 77% in 2014. A string of crimes, including the murder of Sarah Everard by a police officer in 2021, surely contributed, as did a sharp increase in the number of people stopped and searched. And as memories fade of riots in decades past, so too may fears of the baleful consequences of fresh disorder.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: Can Europe’s anti-Putin alliance hold?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping Europe?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">The remarkable unity shown by European governments in 2022—in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine—will probably be tested in 2023. The longer the war continues, the more likely it is that some in Europe will call for a negotiated peace. Some may yearn for a resumption of Russian gas exports; others might fear that Europe will have to shoulder more of the burden if America’s support for Ukraine declines after its presidential election in 2024. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Although these voices are not expected to prevail, they will cause discord and tension. Italy’s economic woes could lead to a weakening of the support for Ukraine that Giorgia Meloni, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-allies-take-power-in-italy">new prime minister</a>, currently espouses. And as more countries slip into recession, the leaders of the poorest may become more amenable to the idea of negotiation—and increasingly bitter towards their wealthier neighbours, which can more easily weather the storm. </p>
