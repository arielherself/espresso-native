<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Hurricane Ian</strong> made <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida">landfall</a> near Fort Myers, <strong>Florida</strong>, and weakened as it ploughed across the peninsula. More than 2m people are without power. With wind speeds near 150mph (240kph) when it struck, Ian had been just shy of the category-five designation, the most severe; it counts anyway as one of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/06/01/why-this-atlantic-hurricane-season-is-predicted-to-be-unusually-stormy">strongest storms</a> on record to wallop America’s mainland. Storm surges as high as 12ft (3.7 metres) were seen along the coast of south-western Florida as the interior was doused by an unrelenting downpour. <strong>Cuba </strong>began restoring power after suffering a complete blackout.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Russia said that it will formally annex four regions of <strong>Ukraine</strong> under its control on Friday. This follows sham <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/27/vladimir-putin-stages-four-fake-referendums-in-occupied-ukraine" data-tegid="tdteovsk97mijk5nl7pgol8rpcklq6re">referendums</a> on joining Russia; President Vladimir Putin’s regime controlled the count and voters were held at gunpoint. Many countries, including Serbia, which has close ties with Russia, said they would not recognise the referendums’ results.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Britain’s prime minister <strong>Liz Truss</strong> said she would not roll back her government’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/27/the-fallout-from-kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-continues">“mini-budget”</a> that has roiled markets and was prepared to take “controversial” steps to boost growth. Her <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically">economic plan</a> triggered a collapse in the value of sterling, now at just about $1.08. On Wednesday the Bank of England shocked analysts by committing itself to buy long-dated government bonds worth £65bn ($70bn) in a bid to calm markets.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>EU</strong> and <strong>NATO</strong> determined that leaks from <strong>Nord Stream 1 and 2</strong>, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/02/22/the-west-imposes-swift-sanctions-on-russia-can-they-stop-a-war">major gas pipelines</a> under the Baltic sea, were caused by sabotage, but stopped short of blaming Russia. On Thursday Sweden’s coastguards reported a fourth leak. Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, said deliberate disruption would receive the “strongest possible response”. Ms von der Leyen also proposed new sanctions on Russia, including an oil price cap.</p>

<p class="customisedFont">The<strong> International Telecommunication Union</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/20/an-election-that-could-make-the-global-internet-safer-for-autocrats">elected</a> Doreen Bogdan-Martin, an American, as its secretary-general. Ms Bogdan-Martin beat Rashid Ismailov, Russia’s former deputy minister of telecoms, by 139 votes to 25, a far more decisive margin than was expected. The result indicates that the ITU’s 193 member-states want a decentralised internet governed by consensus, rather than one controlled by national governments, which Russia and China have pushed for.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s vice-president, <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>, visited the demilitarised zone between the two <strong>Koreas</strong> the day after the North launched two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea. Ms Harris criticised the “provocative nuclear rhetoric” and warned of tough action if Kim Jong Un’s regime conducted its first <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/04/07/north-korea-is-testing-icbms-again-nuclear-weapons-may-be-next">nuclear test</a> in five years, as some expect.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Iranian</strong> missile and drone strikes killed at least 13 people in <strong>Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region</strong>, according to local officials. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/26/irans-rebellion-spreads-despite-lethal-repression">Anti-government protests</a> have swept Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish woman, in police custody. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the cross-border strikes were against “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/19/with-america-distracted-iran-hits-iraqs-kurds">separatist terrorists</a>” who supported the “riots”. Separately, Iran’s president conceded that Ms Amini’s death was “a tragic incident”.</p>

<h3>What drives the world’s most powerful person?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In just over two weeks the Chinese Communist Party will hold its party congress, the most important event in China’s political calendar. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-reads/2022/09/22/what-to-read-to-understand-xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a> will almost certainly be granted a third five-year term as leader, an event unprecedented since the long reign of Mao Zedong ended in 1976.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Over his ten years in charge Mr Xi has shattered decades of cautious, collective leadership and hoarded enormous personal power. Chinese officials argue he needs it to guide the country through global turmoil and turn it into a superpower. Many ordinary Chinese agree. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/09/28/1-redder-than-red">The Prince</a>, our first long-form podcast series, tells the story of Mr Xi’s life, including his traumatic childhood. It is a tale of power in China: how it is won, how it is wielded, and how far some have fallen when it’s taken away.</p>
<h3>A genocide suspect faces trial</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday Félicien Kabuga goes on trial in The Hague, at a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2021/01/02/laws-to-catch-human-rights-abusers-are-growing-teeth">special court</a> set up by the UN in the aftermath of the bloodshed in Rwanda in 1994. The octogenarian faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. He has previously pleaded not guilty, and is likely to do so again. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Once one of Rwanda’s richest men, Mr Kabuga is alleged to have bankrolled ethnic Hutu extremists during the genocide, in which perhaps 500,000 Rwandans were murdered, mainly of the ethnic Tutsi group. An ally of Rwanda’s then-ruling party, Mr Kabuga stands accused of creating, supplying and arming the Interahamwe, a Hutu militia responsible for most of the killing. He also helped found Radio Mille Collines, a radio station that spouted murderous anti-Tutsi propaganda.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">After the genocide Mr Kabuga became one of the world’s most wanted men; he was finally arrested in Paris in May 2020. There are many questions about how he managed to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2020/05/21/felicien-kabuga-africas-most-wanted-man-is-arrested">evade capture</a> for so long. But now, finally, prosecutors have their man exactly where they want him.</p>
<h3>Voting on the future of the internet</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/20/an-election-that-could-make-the-global-internet-safer-for-autocrats">International Telecommunication Union</a> elected its next secretary-general on Thursday at its quadrennial conference. After an intensive campaign, the American candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, one of the ITU’s three directors, won decisively with 139 out of 172 votes against her Russian rival, Rashid Ismailov, a telecoms executive who was once Russia’s deputy minister of telecoms and mass communications, who gathered only 25 votes.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The clear result shows Russia’s isolation on the international stage. But it is also a sign that most of the member countries of the ITU seem to prefer the internet to remain a freewheeling, decentralised global network of networks, governed mostly by consensus, where all interested parties have at least some say. If Mr Ismailov had prevailed, it would have meant that the world prefers a model Russia, but also China, have been pushing for: one that looks more like the telephone system of old—a centralised edifice largely controlled by national governments.</p>
<h3>Porsche’s luxury IPO</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Not every petrolhead can afford a Porsche. But the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/22/porsche-goes-to-market">initial public offering</a> of the German luxury carmaker on Thursday gives fans a chance to own a small share of the company. In a nod to Porsche’s most iconic model, its current owner, Volkswagen Group, issued 911m shares at up to €82.50 ($80) each, although only 114m, with no voting rights, were sold to the public and big investors. The rest will be held by VW, and VW’s largest shareholders, the familial descendants of Porsche’s founders.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The IPO therefore values the most profitable part of VW at €75bn, making it one of the world’s biggest carmakers by market capitalisation. The cash raised will help to pay for VW’s transition to electrification. But if Porsche is to reap the benefits of its tie-up with VW, the erstwhile parent must get a grip on Cariad, its in-house software unit. Problems there have already forced Porsche to postpone the launch of one new model, its e-Macan small SUV. Not the sort of snafu that Porsche is used to.</p>
<h3>End of an era for “FIFA”</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Electronic Arts, an American company, releases “FIFA 23” this week, the latest edition of its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2020/06/27/the-pandemic-has-accelerated-the-growth-of-e-sports">hugely popular</a> football video game. Having sold more than 325m copies since its inception in 1993, every “FIFA” release is an eagerly anticipated event in the gaming calendar. This one, however, is particularly poignant. It marks the end of a successful collaboration between EA and FIFA, football’s governing body. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">FIFA earns an estimated $150m every year for lending its name to the series. It now hopes to rake in more through new games developed with other studios. Some fans will welcome the shake-up. Recent editions of “FIFA” have been criticised for merely repackaging it without any meaningful changes to gameplay or features. The introduction of in-game purchases has been controversial, too, as gaming purists consider a “pay-to-win” model inherently unfair. Such controversies prompted another developer, Strikerz Inc., to enter the market on its own. Through “Ultimate Football League”, which launches in 2023, Strikerz promises to deliver a so-called “fair-to-play” experience, meaning it rewards gamers for their skill rather than their money. </p>
