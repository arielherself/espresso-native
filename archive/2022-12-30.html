According to the region’s governor, Russia launched an “attack by drones” in the early hours of Friday morning. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said his country’s forces had shot down 54 Russian missiles on Thursday. Meanwhile Mr Zelensky’s adviser said Russia is holding more than 3,000 prisoners of war.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Belarus</strong> summoned Ukraine’s ambassador after a missile was downed 15km inside Belarusian territory. Belarus, a Russian ally, demanded an inquiry. Ukraine’s army said the missile was part of its air defences. But the defence ministry did not rule out a “deliberate provocation” by Russia. In November NATO concluded that a missile that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/11/16/anything-exploding-on-nato-soil-during-a-war-is-a-big-deal-fears-rise-after-a-missile-lands-in-poland">hit a farm in Poland</a> was fired by Ukraine.</p>

<h3>2023 in preview: Will flying taxis take off?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will emerge from the fields of science and technology?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">This will be a crucial year for the pioneers developing electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, popularly known as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/11/16/a-new-type-of-air-terminal-opens-for-flying-taxis">flying taxis</a>. These airborne marvels, which navigate using multiple small rotors, much like hovering drones, generally carry fewer than six passengers. With clever software controlling the rotors, they are easier to fly than a helicopter and capable of autonomous flight. A number of firms in Europe and Asia will be carrying out flight trials in 2023 as they move towards obtaining an airworthiness certificate and stepping up commercial production of their aircraft. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Companies are also working hard to get regulators’ approval to carry paying passengers. EHang, a Chinese firm, is working with that country’s aviation administration on flight trials of its two-passenger vehicle, which flies autonomously. In Europe, Volocopter, a German company, is hoping its two-seater VoloCity can be approved in time for the Olympics in Paris in 2024. In 2023, the race to get this industry off the ground will truly begin.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: The war in Ukraine could spur innovation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will emerge from the fields of science and technology?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">Russia’s invasion has prompted Western countries to increase their defence spending. In the past, military technology has found its way into the mainstream. You can thank the efforts of American defence researchers to build computer networks for your ability to read this story (or indeed anything else on the internet). One area of focus today is improving supply chains. Rather than having to transport food, medicine, water and fuel to soldiers in remote locations, American researchers hope to be able to manufacture them all on-site using novel biotechnology. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Another technology to watch is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/22/what-are-the-hypersonic-missiles-russia-says-it-used-in-ukraine">hypersonic weapons</a>, which many countries are developing and which travel at 5-25 times the speed of sound. Venus Aerospace, an American startup, aims to use this technology to build a space plane that could fly passengers between any two points on Earth within an hour. Vladimir Putin’s war, which has brought huge suffering and hardship, may one day have unexpected technological spin-offs.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: A sexual evolution</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will emerge from the fields of science and technology?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">Sex is becoming accepted as an important aspect of a person’s general well-being—something to be maintained and improved. In 2023, this trend will accelerate. Already, 25-30% of adults in America, Britain and France own sex toys; a third of them had bought their devices in the previous three years. Innovative startups in the sexual-pleasure business are particularly attuned to the needs of female customers, in part because they are, unusually for the tech industry, often led by women.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Education about sexual dysfunction, pleasure and how to talk about these topics is also going to get better. Apps and websites run by companies and non-profit groups are making sex education easier to access and less stuffy. They are covering topics that people are generally reluctant to talk about such as masturbation, erectile dysfunction or reaching orgasm. These are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/01/sexual-problems-can-wreck-lives-yet-remedies-are-often-simple">hopeful developments</a>: far too many people have needlessly unhappy sex lives. </p>
<h3>2023 in preview: Big tech’s next big thing</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will emerge from the fields of science and technology?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">The coming year will see big tech firms doubling down on two related, much-hyped possibilities. The first is virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality (AR) headsets, face-strapped gadgets that immerse users in computer-generated worlds. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, currently accounts for around two-thirds of all AR and VR headset sales, but it faces <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/04/09/from-apple-to-google-big-tech-is-building-vr-and-ar-headsets">competition</a> from Apple, which is likely to release a headset next year, and Sony. At $1,499 Meta’s latest headset is pricey; cheaper, more mainstream devices are likely to follow in 2023.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The second is the metaverse, which many hope will replace the internet with a three-dimensional digital landscape. Meta has spent more than $27bn on the metaverse despite scepticism from analysts and investors (its share price has slumped this year). But the video-games business has sold virtual worlds for decades. Epic Games has already held live-music gigs inside “Fortnite”, its popular online battle game. In 2023 the metaverse, which has yet to prove itself for much beyond gaming, may well face a reality check. </p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 GMT on <strong>Friday</strong> to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@te.arielherself.xyz"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5504203c2f102625273026263a1530363a3b3a383c26217b363a38">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown three winners on Saturday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Friday:</strong> Which best-selling book, written by Angela Duckworth, explains how success can be achieved by a combination of passion and persistence?</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Thursday:</strong> What term, which refers to passing a point of no return, relates to an incident in the career of Julius Caesar?</p>
