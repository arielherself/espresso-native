<p class="customisedFont"><strong>King Charles III</strong> delivered his first address as monarch. He honoured the life and service of Queen Elizabeth II and pledged to follow his mother’s example <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/10/22/british-royal-succession-queen-elizabeth">throughout his reign</a>. He praised Britain’s values and achievements, said he would step back from some of his charitable duties and expressed appreciation for his wife and family. The <strong>Accession Council</strong>, a group of senior officials and politicians that convenes following the death of a monarch, will formally proclaim him king on Saturday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Britons entered their first day of <strong>national mourning </strong>following the death of <strong>Elizabeth II</strong>, while tributes poured in from foreign leaders. The queen <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown">died</a> on Thursday, aged 96, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.

Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years, died in April 2021. Her funeral is likely to take place on September 19th.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of <strong>Ukraine</strong>, celebrated the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/29/ukraine-starts-a-push-to-recapture-kherson-a-crucial-russian-occupied-city">counter-offensive</a> launched by his country’s armed forces, saying that 1,000 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory and “dozens of settlements” had been <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims">reclaimed from Russian forces</a> since September 1st. A Russian-appointed official admitted on state television that Ukrainians had achieved a “substantial victory” in breaching Russian defences. Russia retaliated by launching its own attacks on Ukrainian territory, according to Andriy Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>India </strong>and <strong>China </strong>will withdraw troops from a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2020/09/08/india-and-china-exchange-the-first-gunshots-in-45-years">disputed border area</a> in the Himalayas, according to India’s foreign ministry. The withdrawal, which began on Thursday after more than two years of a standoff, will be completed by September 12th. The poorly-defined 3,500km border between the nuclear-armed neighbours has been the site of numerous, and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2020/06/18/india-and-china-have-their-first-deadly-clashes-in-45-years">sometimes deadly</a>, territorial skirmishes.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea </strong>passed a law enshrining its right to have <strong>nuclear weapons</strong> and to protect itself “automatically” by using them in pre-emptive strikes.

<h3>The queen’s death: what happens now</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For years the days following the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era">death of Queen Elizabeth II</a> have been subject to meticulous planning, under the codename “London Bridge”. According to the plan there will be ten days of mourning between the queen’s death and funeral, during which most official business will be suspended. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The queen’s successor, King Charles III, will broadcast to the nation today. He will be formally proclaimed by the Accession Council tomorrow. After that the plan calls for a tour of the kingdom. His mother will lie in state in Westminster Hall for four days, during which time thousands are expected to file past her coffin. Her funeral is expected on September 19th. The new king will be crowned ceremonially months later.</p>
<h3>Elizabeth’s impossible act to follow</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Crowned on June 2nd 1953, Queen Elizabeth was Britain’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-was-the-longest-reigning-monarch-in-british-history">longest-serving monarch</a>. The first of her 15 prime ministers was Winston Churchill; the last, Liz Truss, was sworn in just a few days ago. Elizabeth presided over an <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/08/how-britain-has-changed-since-elizabeth-ii-was-crowned-in-1953">era of dramatic change</a> in her country’s fortunes. Having acceded to the throne of a fading empire, she leaves behind a fissiparous, barely united kingdom. Yet she maintained a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown">dignified silence</a> through it all, as the constitution demanded. Only rarely did she hint at her own views; over the referendum in 2014 on Scottish independence, for instance, warning her subjects to “think very carefully” before voting. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The troughs of her reign were often caused by familial impropriety: the miserable marriage of Charles and Diana; the involvement of Prince Andrew in a transatlantic sex scandal. That the monarchy as an institution remained so popular was mostly down to Elizabeth’s personal example of duty and self-discipline, qualities less obvious in many family members. Queen Elizabeth II will be an almost impossible act to follow. Nonetheless, according to the line of succession, Charles has now become king.</p>
<h3>Musk v Twitter</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Elon Musk’s bid for Twitter smacked of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/04/23/elon-musks-twitter-saga-is-capitalism-gone-rogue">recklessness and mercuriality </a>from the off. Witness his baiting of the social-media firm’s board to his U-turn in July, when he sued Twitter to exit the purchase agreement. His argument that the company had <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up">misrepresented the extent of its spam accounts</a> seemed, to many, a flimsy excuse to abandon a deal on which he had simply soured. In May Mr Musk texted one of his bankers that the bid “wouldn’t make sense…if we’re heading into world war three”, referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But August brought a fillip to Mr Musk’s case. Twitter’s former security chief, Peiter Zatko, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging lax data privacy at the company, as well as bots aplenty. On Friday Mr Musk’s lawyers will question Mr Zatko under oath. Twitter, however, alleges that Mr Musk wanted out because he feared overpaying. Mr Musk will have to prove that bots amounted to a “material adverse effect” on the business—a high legal bar. The trial proper starts on October 17th.</p>
<h3>China’s problem is not inflation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ask an investor to name the world’s most pressing economic problem, and many would say <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/03/does-high-inflation-matter">inflation</a>. But that worry is largely absent from the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/09/worries-about-inflation-in-china-have-been-overhyped">world’s second-biggest economy</a>. Figures released on Friday showed that China’s consumer-price inflation fell to 2.5% in August, compared with a year earlier, still comfortably below the government’s ceiling of 3%.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The price of pork, a key <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2019/09/12/soaring-pork-prices-hog-headlines-and-sow-discontent-in-china">economic indicator</a> in China, has begun to level off and fuel costs have peaked. Price pressure elsewhere in the economy remains subdued. The unremitting threat of lockdowns in response to covid-19 outbreaks is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/06/16/in-stamping-out-covid-china-has-stomped-on-confidence">depressing confidence</a> and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/09/07/zero-covid-is-making-it-tougher-for-chinese-strivers-to-get-ahead">spending</a>. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/21/fresh-woe-for-chinas-property-sector-mortgage-boycotts">debt distress</a> of China’s property developers is undermining home sales, which is only deepening the distress. Even <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/05/14/chinas-extraordinary-export-boom-comes-to-an-end">exports</a>, which have propped up China’s growth this year, have slowed sharply. China does not have the world’s inflation problem, but it has a world of problems all of its own.</p>
<h3>Tackling Europe’s energy crisis</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Another crisis, another emergency European Union meeting. On Friday was the turn of national energy ministers. Europe is grappling with<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices"> mind-boggling fuel prices</a>. Economy-wide spending on gas and electricity could balloon from €200bn ($199bn) before the crisis to €1,400bn, or almost 10% of EU-wide GDP, over the next 12 months. Policymakers need to find ways to help households and businesses through an expensive winter, and to do so in a co-ordinated fashion, since gas and electricity markets across the continent are linked.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The ministers have decided to task the European Commission to come up with proposals to redistribute the excess profits of non-gas power producers to consumers. The EU’s executive arm has also been asked to work on a price cap on gas, which would lower Russia’s export revenues. It will look into voluntary measures to limit peak electricity demand, among others. Its proposals could come as early as next week.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 BST on <strong>Friday</strong> to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@te.arielherself.xyz"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9acbeff3e0dfe9eae8ffe9e9f5dafff9f5f4f5f7f3e9eeb4f9f5f7">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown one winner per continent on Saturday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Friday: </strong>Which vehicle, first introduced at the New York World’s Fair in 1964, is Ford’s longest-produced car brand?</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Thursday: </strong>What is the term for the smallest unit of information in a computer?</p>
