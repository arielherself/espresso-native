<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> promised to stay in the race to become Speaker of America’s <strong>House of Representatives</strong>. He <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2023/01/04/republicans-struggle-to-elect-a-speaker-of-the-house">lost three successive votes</a> on Tuesday as 20 right-wing Republicans withheld their support. It marks the first time in a century that the lower chamber of Congress failed to elect a leader in a single poll. The rebels have coalesced behind Jim Jordan, though he lacks the support of the rest of the caucus. With their narrow majority, any Republican would need all but four of his party’s votes. Voting is to resume on Wednesday and will continue until a Speaker is chosen.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia</strong> blamed a <strong>Ukrainian missile attack </strong>that killed at least 89 Russian troops on Sunday on its own soldiers’ use of mobile phones. The defence ministry said the “mass use” of personal mobiles, which is banned, helped Ukrainian forces locate the troops in Makiivka, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/23/making-sense-of-vladimir-putins-war">Russian-occupied</a> town in the Donbas region. Ukraine, and some Russian military bloggers, have claimed the casualty count was far higher.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Inflation in France</strong> unexpectedly slowed in December, according to provisional figures, as energy prices eased. INSEE, the national statistics office, said annualised <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/10/28/frances-finance-minister-on-how-to-fight-inflation-and-preserve-stability">inflation</a> fell from 7.1% in November to 6.7% in December; economists had expected a small rise. The figures provide more welcome economic news in the euro zone after a similar fall in German inflation for December was announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s </strong>Food and Drug Administration will allow American chemists to stock <strong>“abortion pills”</strong>, even as access to the actual procedure is curtailed by the Supreme Court’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/26/the-fallout-from-overturning-roe">repudiation of <em>Roe v Wade</em></a>. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/02/05/a-safe-and-simple-abortion-option-becomes-more-readily-available">Mifepristone</a>, a drug used to induce abortions, had previously been available through clinics; now the federal government will allow any customer with a prescription to buy it. Roughly half of the state governments, however, ban it entirely.</p>

<p class="customisedFont">The European Commission indicated that it is likely to require <strong>covid-19 testing</strong> of all inbound <strong>travellers from China</strong> to the EU. Its member states have “converged” on the restriction, according to a spokesperson; several have already imposed it on their own. Despite its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/28/covid-19-is-tearing-through-china" data-tegid="6ns1g79lg19v2m9ek6tl63hu6igvt93d">still-rising wave of infections</a>, China complained that such <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/02/what-the-great-reopening-means-for-china-and-the-world">restrictions</a> were ginned up “for political purposes”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Twitter</strong> said it would reverse a ban on <strong>political advertising </strong>permitted on its platform, implemented in 2019. The firm also said it would relax its policy towards “cause-based ads”. The changes are the latest in a series of shake-ups introduced by Elon Musk, who has mostly spooked advertisers since <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/19/elon-musks-44bn-education-on-free-speech">buying Twitter</a> in October.</p>

Temperatures in Poland beat the country’s previous record for the month by 0.3°C; beach-goers basked in around 25°C in Bilbao, the hottest-ever January day in the Spanish city. Scientists warn that climate change can cause <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/the-increase-in-simultaneous-heatwaves">extreme temperature patterns</a> to intensify.</p>

<h3>America’s economy loses its mojo</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The world’s biggest economy may be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-american-economy-is-set-for-a-downturn-not-a-crisis">limping into the new year</a>. A survey of America’s manufacturing sector, due out on Wednesday, is expected to reveal that in December it contracted for a second consecutive month. If so, it will add to evidence that the economy is on the cusp of a recession as the Federal Reserve’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done">aggressive tightening</a> of monetary policy makes its impact felt.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A crucial question is how the Fed will respond to the slowdown. Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting, when it last raised interest rates, will be released on Wednesday, too. Analysts will pore over the month-old details to glean hints about the central bank’s thinking. The new data and minutes, though, will pale in importance compared with a jobs report on Friday. So long as America’s labour market remains robust, the Fed is likely to persist with raising rates. It worries that wage pressures will keep inflation high, even as the economy sputters.</p>
<h3>What Ukraine’s bullseye says about the war</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine rang in the new year as Russian cruise missiles rained down on Kyiv. Hours later the country had its revenge. Using American-supplied HIMARS rocket-launchers, it destroyed a temporary barracks in a school in Makviika, in eastern Donetsk province. Russia’s defence ministry has said that 89 soldiers were killed. Ukraine and some Russian commentators say the true figure is in the hundreds.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The strike sparked fury in Russia with its military leadership. “Our generals are untrainable,” thundered Igor Girkin, who led Russia’s first invasion of Donbas in 2014. The attack shows how Russian forces still make elementary mistakes: Ukraine is thought to have picked up the mobile-phone signals of the Russian troops in the school. It also illustrates the vital role of attrition in the war, as Ukraine uses long-range precision weapons to wear down Russian forces—much as it did before offensives in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/11/15/the-battle-for-kherson-in-maps">Kherson</a> and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces">Kharkiv</a> last year. Thinner Russian lines could pave the way for another <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/three-scenarios-for-how-war-in-ukraine-could-play-out">Ukrainian advance</a>.</p>
<h3>France’s better news on inflation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Thanks to generous government subsidies and a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/15/the-french-exception">low dependency on Russian gas</a>, France has been relatively <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/10/28/frances-finance-minister-on-how-to-fight-inflation-and-preserve-stability">well protected</a> from Europe’s soaring inflation. In the year to November 2022 the French inflation rate, at 7.1%, was the second-lowest in the euro zone, after Spain’s. Indeed against expectations, provisional figures published on Wednesday by the national statistics office showed that year-on-year inflation slowed in December, to 6.7%. The Bank of France expects the country’s inflation rate to peak in the first half of 2023.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This comes at a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/17/emmanuel-macrons-tricky-second-term">tricky time</a> for President Emmanuel Macron’s government. It has just ended petrol subsidies at the pump, and raised the cap on increases to electricity and gas bills to 15%. Support will be limited to small firms, such as the corner <em>boulangerie</em>. Higher costs of living will be keenly felt by many families, just as the government is controversially planning to raise the retirement age. France, no stranger to bread riots, could be in for a turbulent year.</p>
<h3>Myanmar’s sour toast to independence</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">At precisely 4.20 on Wednesday morning a four-hour military parade kicked off in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar. In 1948, this was the time deemed most auspicious by astrologers for the country, then known as Burma, to declare independence from British imperial rule. Seventy-five years on, the generals now in charge are overseeing a gala of concerts and sporting tournaments.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But few citizens are sharing in the revelry. Many feel shackled anew since the army seized power in a coup nearly two years ago, destroying the country’s brief experiment in democratisation. Suppression of dissent has spiralled into an all-out <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/01/29/myanmars-grinding-conflict-is-at-risk-of-being-forgotten">civil war</a>; armed opposition groups claim to control almost half the country. And the conflict has reverberated far beyond Myanmar’s borders as hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. Even the generals’ traditional independence day promise to release prisoners won’t lighten the mood much; of the 7,000 mentioned on Wednesday, it is unclear whether any will be political detainees.</p>
<h3>Netflix and shill: Madoff on film</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Fourteen years after his arrest, and almost two years after his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2021/04/22/bernard-madoff-died-in-prison-on-april-14th">death in prison</a>, Bernie Madoff is getting the Netflix treatment. “Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street”, a four-part docuseries about the mega-swindler, is released on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Madoff’s Ponzi-scheming has already inspired a welter of books, plays and television dramas, as well as a documentary about his secretary. Is there anything left to tell? Netflix insists there is. It promises “unique access to whistleblowers, employees, investigators and victims”, as well as “never-before-seen video depositions of Madoff himself”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There are unlikely to be startling revelations. Nevertheless, the story of New York’s dodgiest investor continues to resonate, and in one important sense is not over: a liquidator is still recovering and distributing funds to bilked investors. More than $14bn has been handed back so far, with more expected in 2023. For many who lost money, the anguish and suspense continue.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 GMT on Friday to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@te.arielherself.xyz"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2a7b5f43506f595a584f5959456a4f494544454743595e04494547">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
