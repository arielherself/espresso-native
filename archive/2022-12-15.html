<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Central banks </strong>in Britain and the euro zone followed the lead of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">Federal Reserve</a> by raising interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, lower than the previous rises of 0.75. The<strong> Bank of England’s </strong>hike—its ninth consecutive rise—took its rate to 3.5%, the highest level in 14 years. Meanwhile, the <strong>European Central Bank </strong>raised its rate from 1.5% to 2%, the highest since the global financial crisis in 2008. The ECB suggested it expects further rises to come as inflation remains well-above its medium-term 2% target, even if it has reached its peak. Euro-zone inflation was 10% in November, down from 10.6% in October.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Economic activity</strong> in <strong>China</strong> diminished in November. Retail sales actually fell, by 5.9% year-on-year, while industrial output growth slowed to 2.2% from 5% in the previous month. Both consumer demand and production had been hit hard by the country’s zero-covid policy. That is now <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/07/china-is-loosening-its-covid-restrictions-at-great-risk">being wound down</a>, but the resulting surge in covid infections will cause disruptions of its own.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that 64 Ukrainian prisoners of war had been freed from Russian captivity in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/05/how-do-prisoner-swaps-work">a prisoner exchange</a>. An American citizen was also freed in the swap. Ukrainian officials did not say how many Russian prisoners they released in return. Meanwhile, an “unknown drone” struck a Russian airbase in Kursk, near the border with Ukraine, according to the latter country’s officials.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong> unloaded $3.6bn more of shares in his electric car company, <strong>Tesla</strong>. That brings the total to almost $23bn since Mr Musk announced a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">$44bn takeover of Twitter</a>. Tesla’s shares fell by more than 60% this year. Investors are worried that inflation could squeeze demand for the company’s fancy cars—and that its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/12/01/elon-musk-is-showing-what-a-waste-of-time-twitter-can-be">boss is too distracted</a> to run the firm.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Peru’s</strong> government declared a 30-day <strong>state of emergency</strong> to quell protests by supporters of Pedro Castillo, the former president whom lawmakers removed from office after he attempted to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/12/07/after-a-bungled-coup-attempt-perus-president-falls">dissolve the legislature</a>. The order gives more authority to police and the army, allowing them to search homes without warrants, for example. Prosecutors are seeking to detain Mr Castillo for 18 months while he awaits trial.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The UN postponed decisions about whether to allow representatives from <strong>Afghanistan’s </strong>Taliban administration and <strong>Myanmar’s </strong><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/15/an-economically-illiterate-junta-is-running-myanmar-into-the-ground">military junta</a> to represent their countries at the general assembly. The UN’s assent would have been an important step in both regimes’ quests for international recognition. For now the envoys that preceded regime changes in both countries will retain their positions. The UN will revisit the issue in nine months. </p>

<h3>America’s asylum woes</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In March 2020 the Trump administration invoked a rarely used public-health measure to expel migrants at its border with Mexico—including those seeking asylum—in the name of stopping covid-19. After immigrant-rights groups sued, a judge ordered in mid-November that the policy, known as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/05/22/the-title-42-furore-highlights-americas-broken-immigration-system">Title 42</a>, end next week. But 19 Republican-led states appealed against that decision, and sought a ruling by Friday. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Even with the policy in place, there were a record 2.4m arrests at the border in the year to September. Those who want to keep Title 42 in place say scrapping it will see even more illicit border-crossings, overwhelming America’s already-frazzled asylum system. In recent days thousands of mainly Nicaraguan migrants, exempted from Title 42 because America will not expel them to Mexico or to their repressive home country, have poured into south Texas. Whatever the measure’s fate this week, the episode reveals a broader problem: America’s<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/05/20/how-to-untangle-the-immigration-mess-in-america"> immigration policy</a> is being set largely by the judiciary.</p>
<h3>A doveish turn at the ECB?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The gathering of the European Central Bank’s governing council on Thursday was its last this year. Its battle against inflation was, once again, top of the agenda. The bank matched market expectations by raising interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 2%. That is the euro zone’s highest rate since the financial crash in 2008, but the hike was smaller than the rises of 0.75 percentage points agreed at the last two meetings. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The ECB’s decision follows the Federal Reserve’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">move</a> to slow the intensity of its interest-rate rises—also opting for a hike of 0.5 percentage points—after America’s inflation figures, published on Tuesday, were lower than expected. Europe is months behind America in its inflation cycle, but last month’s figures suggested that headline inflation in the euro zone may also <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/07/inflation-is-falling-but-not-enough">have started to retreat</a>. That will have helped the arguments of those sceptical about further steep rate increases. The news may suggest that the peak in rates is near, but the ECB warned that it still expects further rises to come. </p>
<h3>Adobe’s reinvention comes undone</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday Adobe, a software company, will report its fourth-quarter results. The firm is best known for inventing the “portable document format” (PDF), and for Photoshop, its image-editing tool. But more recently Adobe has gradually reinvented itself with fresh products, including software for editing websites and videos. That has helped turn it into the world’s third-biggest software company, behind Oracle and Microsoft, worth some $160bn.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But that valuation has slumped in the past year. Like all tech firms, Adobe has been battered by inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. Indeed, it has suffered more than most. In the past 12 months the firm’s share price has dropped by 44%, compared with a fall of 26% for the Nasdaq composite, a tech-heavy index. One explanation is Adobe’s attempt to purchase Figma, a design-software firm, for $20bn. Investors baulked at the proposed price when it was announced in September, sending Adobe’s share price tumbling. They will be watching for any details about the acquisition, expected to be completed in 2023. </p>
<h3>More trouble for Britain’s National Health Service</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">With a record 7.2m people in England waiting for treatment, and a third of people in hospitals’ emergency departments waiting over four hours to be seen by a doctor, Britain’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/29/the-national-health-service-faces-a-terrible-winter">treasured NHS</a> is at breaking point. And the problems are mounting. On Thursday 100,000 nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland began the first of two planned walkouts after the government refused to agree to their demand for an inflation-busting pay rise of 19%. (A similar strike in Scotland was called off.) It is the first strike in the 106-year history of the Royal College of Nursing, Britain’s main nursing union. Physiotherapists and, in Wales, midwives have also voted to strike. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Critics say such action risks endangering patients’ lives. Nurses say that chronic understaffing is already doing that. During the pandemic, Britons gathered each week to clap for “NHS heroes”; so far they seem sympathetic to the strikes. That could yet change</p>
<h3>How to design the World Cup</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Thirty-two countries participated at the World Cup in Qatar before Argentina and France emerged as finalists, the same number as in every tournament since 1998. But at the next one, in 2026, 48 will do so. Some fans fear the quality of the tournament will suffer. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">It is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/12/14/how-to-design-a-perfect-world-cup">not obvious</a> how to organise such an expanded World Cup. The first consideration is which teams get to qualify. FIFA, football’s governing body, wants to earmark more slots for teams from Africa and Asia. Europe’s share will fall from around 40% to a third. The second, trickier quandary is how to determine the winner. A league system, with every team playing every other, would be fair but take far too long; a straight knockout set-up would leave fans of teams that exit early feeling unsatisfied. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even">Group stages</a>, the current arrangement, are an option, but 48 is an unwieldy number to whittle down. FIFA says it is still considering the structure of the competition. Whatever it decides will initially feel awkward. </p>
