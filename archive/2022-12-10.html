Russia will provide fighter jets to Iran and is training its pilots, said a spokesman for America’s national security council.

<p class="customisedFont">Arizona’s senator <strong>Kyrsten Sinema</strong> said she would leave the <strong>Democratic Party</strong> and become an independent, just days after the Democrats won an expanded majority of 51-49 in the Senate. The Democrats will still hold a majority without her, because America’s vice-president, Kamala Harris, gets a deciding vote. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/06/12/kyrsten-sinemas-technicolour-moderation">Ms Sinema</a> wrote that she had “never fit perfectly in either national party” in part because of “extreme” voices driving them towards the parties’ fringes.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Markus Dohle</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Penguin Random House</strong>, the world’s biggest book publisher, resigned after a deal to buy Simon &amp; Schuster, a rival, collapsed in October.

The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2020/11/26/bertelsmann-snaps-up-simon-and-schuster">failed deal</a> cost the publisher $200m in termination fees.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Britain’s</strong> government announced plans to “cut red tape” from <strong>financial regulation</strong> to “turbocharge growth”. The finance ministry’s package of 30 planned reforms will review “burdensome” EU rules, as well as some that were introduced after the financial crisis—including one that requires banks and insurers to keep track of staff responsible for specific activities, making it easier for regulators to punish offenders if things go wrong.</p>

<h3>China unleashes its population, and inflation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">China’s draconian<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/06/china-is-dismantling-its-zero-covid-machine"> zero-covid policy</a>, which relied on mass testing and lockdowns to quash outbreaks of the virus, had many economic side-effects. It depressed consumer confidence, disrupted supply chains and paralysed business travel. But it also kept a lid on inflation. While central banks elsewhere have been fighting hard against advancing prices, China has been a non-combat zone of price stability. Figures released on Friday showed that China’s inflation fell to just 1.6% in November, compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But now that the government is<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/07/china-is-loosening-its-covid-restrictions-at-great-risk"> haphazardly abandoning</a> its zero-covid approach, will inflationary pressure pick up? A scary “exit wave” of covid infections may keep confidence, spending and prices in check over the next few months. After that, however, China’s economy could boom again, driving up prices both at home and further afield. In<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/12/07/what-happens-when-china-reopens"> rejoining the global economy</a>, China may also join, and prolong, the global battle against inflation.</p>
<h3>Russia’s struggles in its own backyard</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday the capital of Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, hosts a leaders’ summit of the Eurasian Economic Union. The group consists of five ex-Soviet states—Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia—and aims to develop a single market like that of the European Union. The bloc’s economic achievements are modest. It has signed some free trade deals with countries such as Iran and Vietnam, though a long-awaited deal with India is yet to come to fruition.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the EEU’s real purpose is to serve as a vehicle for Russia to lord its influence over former Soviet territories. On this front Russia faces several challenges. Its war in Ukraine <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/20/central-asian-countries-are-subtly-distancing-themselves-from-russia">spooked</a> leaders in Central Asia who fear that the Kremlin’s aggression may yet turn eastwards. Moreover, China’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/06/two-new-railway-lines-could-transform-central-asia">economic influence</a> in the region is growing. None of the bloc’s members <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/06/23/central-asian-governments-fret-over-shrinking-remittances-from-russia">could afford</a> to disentangle themselves from Russia entirely, yet the winds of change are blowing in Eurasia. And not in the direction the Kremlin would like.</p>
<h3>Saudi Arabia cosies up to China</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When Xi Jinping leaves Saudi Arabia on Friday, he will have signed a stack of economic agreements and sent a none-too-subtle message to Joe Biden. The Chinese president met Saudi leaders, including the crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, on his very first day in Riyadh on Wednesday. On Friday he will attend two summits, one with Gulf states, the other with a wider group of Middle Eastern countries. These are the largest-ever such gatherings between Chinese and Arab leaders.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The meetings underscore a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/07/the-gulf-looks-to-china">growing relationship</a>. China imports most of its oil from Arab states. It has signed $223bn-worth of investment deals and contracts with countries in the region since 2005. Increasingly, it is also a supplier of surveillance kit and military gear. Mr Biden has urged Arab states, particularly those in the Gulf, to keep some distance from China. After a decade of often-tense relations with America, though, they do not seem keen to listen.</p>
<h3>Britain thinks inflation has passed its peak</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Interest-rate setters at the Bank of England play a big role in<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/24/britains-economic-outlook-is-very-gloomy"> Britain’s economic health</a>. The higher expectations of inflation drift, the more aggressively they will fight. On Friday the bank published the results of a survey of the public that shine light on its progress. In August, respondents expected annualised inflation to loiter around 3.1% in five years’ time. The latest poll, conducted in November, showed a rise to 3.3%.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The data will bolster the case to continue with punchy rate increases. Pantheon Macroeconomics, a forecaster, expects that annual inflation<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/17/british-inflation-hits-double-digits"> peaked</a> in October at 11.1%, as shipping costs slump and food-price rises slow. Moreover, a separate survey in the same month showed business expectations of inflation in three years’ time falling to 4%, down from their highest level of 4.8%. Both figures are still well above the official target of 2%—but they seem to be moving in the right direction.</p>
<h3>Best foot forward at the World Cup</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/17/the-qatar-world-cup-shows-how-football-is-changing">World Cup</a> moves from the smorgasbord of the last 16 teams to the refined offering of the quarter-finals on Friday, fans will have more chance to savour the qualities of the best players. Among the contenders for the Golden Ball, which is awarded to the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even">tournament’s</a> best player, is France’s forward Kylian Mbappé. His combination of pace and power evokes memories of Brazil’s Ronaldo. Stopping Mr Mbappe will be a key focus of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/01/the-world-cups-group-stage-bodes-well-for-morocco-and-england">England’s quarter-final preparations</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Another contender is Brazil’s spearhead, Richarlison, who has scored three skilful goals and will aim for more when his team faces Croatia on Friday. Argentina will look to their talismanic star <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2021/08/14/by-the-numbers-lionel-messi-is-european-footballs-best-scorer-ever">Lionel Messi</a> to overcome the Netherlands later on the same day. Meanwhile, Portugal have relied not on the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/17/lionel-messi-and-cristiano-ronaldo-have-forged-modern-football">fading Cristiano Ronaldo</a> but on midfielder Bruno Fernandes and 39-year-old defensive stalwart Pepe. To progress on Saturday they will need to find a way past Morocco’s Yassine Bounou, who saved two penalties against Spain.</p>
