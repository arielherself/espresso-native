<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russian</strong> troops retreated from <strong>Lyman</strong>, a key logistics hub in Donetsk, hours after Ukrainian forces entered the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts">city</a>. Ukraine said the recapture would allow its military to advance into Luhansk, a region Russia took over in July. The retreat comes after Vladimir Putin’s illegal annexation of four regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk and Luhank. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/16/who-is-ramzan-kadyrov-the-brutal-chechen-leader-claiming-to-be-in-ukraine">Ramzan Kadyrov</a>, the leader of Chechnya, a region in southern Russia, urged Mr Putin to take “more drastic measures”, including “the use of low-yield nuclear weapons”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">At least 174 people were killed in a stampede after a football match in <strong>Indonesia</strong>. Supporters of Arema FC, a club from Malang, East Java, rushed onto the pitch after their team lost to regional rivals, Persebaya Surabaya. Local police retaliated with tear gas which triggered a stampede, according to the region’s police chief. Fixtures in the league have been suspended until an investigation is completed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The death toll from <strong>Hurricane Ian</strong> continued to rise as it moved into Virginia. At least 54 people have died so far—almost all of them in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida">Florida</a>. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are without power. President Joe Biden will visit Florida on Wednesday to survey the damage there. Ian is expected to dissipate by Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Liz Truss</strong> acknowledged that her government should have laid “the ground better” for her <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically">mini-budget</a> on September 23rd; the extensive tax cuts provoked a panic on the money markets and a run on the pound. Britain’s prime minister was answering questions in an interview on the eve of her Conservative Party’s annual conference. She nonetheless stood by the cuts and her general economic policy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> and <strong>Venezuela</strong> conducted a prisoner swap, with seven Americans exchanged for two relatives of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/08/18/venezuelas-dictator-is-less-isolated-than-he-once-was">Nicolás Maduro</a>, Venezuela’s president. The freed Americans included five executives from Citgo, an oil company. The transfer, a result of months of secretive talks between both governments, does not change <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2019/08/08/america-heaps-more-sanctions-on-venezuela">America’s policy</a> towards Venezuela, according to an American offical.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Exit polls from <strong>Latvia </strong>showed that New Unity, a party led by Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins, a staunch critic of Vladimir Putin, was set to win the general election by a sizeable margin. Its political rival, the Harmony party, which draws most of its support from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2018/10/11/why-russian-latvians-vote-for-their-own">Latvia&#x27;s ethnic Russian population</a>, is projected to have not won enough votes to enter parliament.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Poland </strong>began to receive gas from Norway through a new pipeline running from the Baltic Sea to Poland via Denmark.

Meanwhile, <strong>Bulgaria </strong>and <strong>Greece </strong>began operating their long-delayed gas pipeline. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called it a “game changer” and said it would deliver “freedom from dependency on Russian gas”.</p>

<h3>Weekend profile: Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin’s private-army supremo</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">This week <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/who-is-yevgeny-prigozhin-the-man-behind-the-wagner-group">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a> stepped out of the shadows. The close ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, admitted for the first time that he founded the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation">Wagner Group</a>, a network of guns-for-hire that does much of Russia’s dirty work. “I cleaned the old weapons myself, sorted out the bulletproof vests myself,” said Mr Prigozhin of Wagner’s early days.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The mercenaries emerged in Ukraine in 2014 to aid Russia’s annexation of Crimea and back up pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The group then expanded wherever Russia had an interest, including <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2017/11/02/how-wagner-came-to-syria">Syria</a>, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2019/12/12/foreign-powers-are-piling-into-libya">Libya</a>, the Central African Republic and Mali.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">As for Mr Prigozhin, little is known about his childhood. He spent most of his 20s in prison, serving nine years for robbery and fraud. After his release, he set up a hot-dog stand in St Petersburg in the 1990s. He soon opened chic eateries: his New Island floating restaurant was a favourite of Mr Putin, at the time deputy mayor of St Petersburg. His associations with Russia’s elite brought lucrative catering gigs for schools, hospitals and the army—and earned him the nickname “Putin’s Chef”. But it was his work outside the kitchen that earned him a reputation in the West. In 2018 American prosecutors indicted Mr Prigozhin, alleging that he financed a Russian “troll farm” to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2018/02/17/putins-chef-cooks-up-a-storm">spread online misinformation</a> during the presidential election in 2016.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Prigozhin long denied involvement in Wagner’s bloody operation, and sued journalists who suggested as much. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine the group may have helped capture several eastern cities. Mr Prigozhin is putting his name to that. He may think that Russia’s tattered relationship with the West means there is no more point in maintaining the open secret. He may also be reminding Mr Putin, amid <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces">battlefield losses</a> and a backlash against mobilisation at home, of his loyalty and value.</p>

<h3>Leopoldstadt comes to New York</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Often hailed as Britain’s greatest living playwright, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2015/01/15/tom-stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a> has long used his erudite, linguistically dazzling plays to probe philosophical ideas. But his latest work, “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2020/02/13/tom-stoppards-haunting-new-play-about-the-holocaust">Leopoldstadt</a>”, gets more personal. Set in Vienna between 1899 and 1955, it traces the fate of a large and very well-off Jewish family that had assumed that success and assimilation made them more Viennese than Jewish. As the decades pass, they learn that their finery and oil portraits won’t keep them out of Auschwitz. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">At 85, Sir Tom seems to be finally reckoning with his own inheritance, having lost his four Jewish grandparents and much of his Czech family to the horrors of the Holocaust. With this play, he elegantly conveys the guilt that comes with survival, and the duty to remember what was lost. The show, now at the Longacre Theatre on Broadway after an acclaimed run in London, also reminds the audience that this all happened not so long ago.</p>
<h3>One nation, one fertiliser in India</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">No government in India wishes to upset <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/11/19/why-has-narendra-modi-abandoned-cherished-plans-to-overhaul-indian-farming">farmers</a>, a votebank of more than 100m. So when the war in Ukraine sent fertiliser prices soaring, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was quick to act. Within two months it announced new subsidies worth $8bn, on top of bulky existing ones. As a result, the expected cost of subsidising fertilisers this fiscal year will reach 2.5trn rupees ($31bn), around 1% of the country’s GDP.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Naturally, the government also wants to get credit for this largesse. From Sunday all bags of fertiliser sold in the country must be emblazoned with government insignia. Private fertiliser firms complain this will hurt their brands, but the government insists that uniformity will streamline distribution. The opposition has called the move a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/05/19/indias-politicians-have-figured-out-how-to-turn-welfare-into-votes">marketing</a> gimmick by Narendra Modi, the prime minister, and the BJP. There is a clue in the project’s official name: <em>Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Urvarak Pariyojna</em>, meaning Prime Minister’s all-India fertiliser scheme, which shortens handily to “PMBJP”.</p>
<h3>Will Brazil get rid of Bolsonaro?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Brazilians cast their ballots on Sunday in the first round of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/09/08/jair-bolsonaro-is-poised-to-lose-the-brazilian-election">presidential election</a> that pits the right-wing populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, against leftist former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The campaign has been marked by polarisation and violence. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/29/are-brazils-pollsters-right-about-the-presidential-election">Polls</a> suggest that Lula will beat Mr Bolsonaro by anywhere from six to 17 percentage points.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But can Lula win the election outright? If no candidate gets more than 50% of votes in the first round, a run-off will be held on October 30th. Some polls suggest that Lula could pull it off. A “switch the vote” campaign seeks to convince backers of Ciro Gomes and Simone Tebet, candidates with around 5% apiece, to vote instead for Lula. Many fear that Mr Bolsonaro will <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/win-or-lose-jair-bolsonaro-poses-a-threat-to-brazilian-democracy">reject the result if he loses</a>. Should Lula manage a first-round win, Mr Bolsonaro will have a tough time upholding his bogus claims of fraud. But like his hero, Donald Trump, that won’t stop him from trying.</p>
<h3>The hidden meaning of horror</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Blumhouse Productions, a film and television company, is responsible for some of the most popular horror movies of the past couple of decades. “Paranormal Activity”, a film presented as if it was made up of found video recordings, was released in 2007 and earned almost $200m from a paltry production budget of $15,000. “The Purge” franchise has made more than $450m at the box office. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The company has now lent its name to “Blumhouse’s Compendium of Horror”, a documentary series which airs on Sunday in America. The show makes a simple—and somewhat repetitive—argument: that the horror genre, far from purveying cheap, gory thrills, has always <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/01/04/film-makers-are-finding-horror-not-comfort-in-the-natural-world">held a mirror up to society</a>. “Dracula”, the talking heads say, encapsulated feelings about the wealthy during the Great Depression. “Godzilla” drew on Japanese viewers’ grim memories of atomic bombs. Blumhouse, it seems, considers itself part of a venerable tradition of collective catharsis. </p>
