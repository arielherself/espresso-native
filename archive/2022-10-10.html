<p class="customisedFont"><strong>President Vladimir Putin</strong> said the explosion that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/08/ukraine-braces-for-retaliation-after-an-attack-on-the-bridge-from-crimea-to-russia">crippled</a> the <strong>Kerch bridge</strong>, linking the Crimean peninsula to Russia, was “an act of terrorism” carried out by Ukrainian special forces. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Mr Putin will hold a meeting of his national security council on Monday amid calls within Russia for retributive attacks. The bridge is a crucial supply line for Russia’s invading forces in southern Ukraine. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>The Kremlin</strong> praised <strong>OPEC+</strong>, a group of petroleum-exporting countries and their allies, which includes Russia, for agreeing to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut">oil production cuts</a>. Joe Biden, America’s president, had opposed the cuts as he faces rising fuel prices ahead of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate">midterm elections</a>. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, described the decision as “balanced” while Janet Yellen, America’s Treasury secretary, called it “unhelpful”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea’s</strong> state news agency said that the country’s <strong>testing of 12 ballistic missiles</strong> over the past week, including one which flew over Japan, was intended to simulate a nuclear attack to “wipe out” targets in South Korea. The launches were a response to recent <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/18/america-and-south-korea-restart-their-big-military-drills">American and South Korean naval drills</a> around the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Social Democrats—the party of Germany’s chancellor—came first in <strong>regional elections</strong> in the north-western state of <strong>Lower Saxony</strong>. It won a third of the votes, according to early results. But the liberal Free Democrats, the SPD’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2021/11/27/olaf-scholzs-coalition-prepares-to-take-office-in-germany">federal coalition partner</a>, failed to reach the 5% threshold needed to enter the state parliament. The hard-right Alternative for Germany took nearly 11%, double its previous share. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Alexander Van der Bellen, <strong>Austria’s</strong> president, won a second term, defeating the populist opposition by a wider margin than in 2016. With most of the votes counted, Mr Van der Bellen had 55.4% of ballots, while Walter Rosenkranz of the Freedom Party, a far-right group, had 18.4%.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Landslides in <strong>Venezuela</strong> killed at least 22 people, after rivers broke their banks in the Santos Michelena municipality, around 70km south of Caracas, the capital. The disaster came after <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2019/01/29/deadly-landslides-with-man-made-causes-are-becoming-more-common">days of heavy rain</a>. Around 50 people are also reported to be missing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Nicola Sturgeon, <strong>Scotland’s</strong> first minister, said she was “confident” that a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/06/29/nicola-sturgeon-sets-a-date-for-another-referendum-on-scottish-independence">Scottish independence referendum</a> could be held next year, despite the British government’s refusal to approve such a vote. On Tuesday Britain’s top court will hear a case about whether or not a plebiscite can go ahead. Scots rejected independence in 2014.</p>

<h3>Uganda’s fickle father-and-son act</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Expect some awkwardness in Kampala on Sunday as Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, hosts his Kenyan counterpart, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/16/who-is-william-ruto">William Ruto</a>, for the 60th anniversary of Ugandan independence. Just days ago Mr Museveni issued a public apology after his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, joked on Twitter about invading Kenya. In other tweets General Kainerugaba reiterated his support for Russia’s warmongering president, Vladimir Putin, and offered a hundred cows to woo <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/25/italy-chooses-a-party-with-a-neo-fascist-legacy">Italy’s new prime minister</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">His outbursts hint at deeper frustration. Mr Museveni, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2021/01/16/yoweri-museveni-wins-ugandas-flawed-presidential-election">in power since 1986</a>, is preparing to run again in 2026. But General Kainerugaba apparently wants the top job himself. He has complained that the next election will mark “40 years of the old people in charge”. On Tuesday Mr Museveni stripped him of his army command, cushioning the blow by promoting him to a higher titular rank. The relationship between overbearing father and stroppy son could one day do even greater damage to Uganda’s politics.</p>
<h3>Scandal splits the chess world</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The chess world champion, Magnus Carlsen, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/07/hans-moke-niemann-is-known-to-have-cheated-at-chess-does-he-still">refuses to play</a> another (ostensibly) top player, Hans Moke Niemann. Though Mr Carlsen won’t say so directly, perhaps for legal reasons, the suspicion is that Mr Niemann uses hidden computers to help him win. Does he?</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Niemann has said that he once cheated as a 12-year-old in an online tournament and then in some “random games” when aged 16. But he has denied ever doing so in tournament games or in front of an audience. On October 4th Chess.com, a website where most of the world’s top players play, published allegations that, in its view, he had cheated much more than he had let on. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Chess.com has disinvited him from a $1m tournament. Yet in offline games, in which Mr Niemann continues to deny all claims of cheating, he plays on. After his recent victory in the first round of the US Chess Championships, he said: “chess speaks for itself.”</p>
<h3>Cate Blanchett’s riveting performance in “Tár”</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Cate Blanchett shines bright as Lydia Tár, the magnetic leader of a classical orchestra, in Todd Field’s film, released this week. Ms Tár’s ascent as the first female conductor of a prominent German orchestra sets the stage for a dramatic tumble, as she is consumed by behind-the-curtain politics. “Tár” dwells on the conductor’s habit of self-sabotage: humiliating a black student at the Juilliard School performing-arts academy in New York; lusting after a young cellist in her orchestra; and alienating her devoted wife and her assistant.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The film portrays the classical-music milieu with refreshing detail, even if the story of powerful figures whose abuses catch up with them has become a newspaper staple. Yet for all the echoes of celebrity falls from grace, the film is at heart a familiar tale of hubris, portrayed with Ms Blanchett’s flair for grandeur.</p>
<h3>Gene editing for a better beer</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Beer brewing typifies the transformative effect of the Industrial Revolution. What had existed for millennia as an artisanal pursuit is today dominated by giant conglomerates and towering steel cylinders. But mass production doesn’t mean a better taste: carbon dioxide build-up in the deep vats inhibits yeast from producing fruity flavours, especially the banana-like isoamyl acetate. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Belgian microbiologists have genetically modified yeast to make more delectable beer, according to a new paper published in <em>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</em>, a journal. The scientists screened DNA of a strain of yeast particularly good at retaining its flavour to find the genetic mutation of one gene that makes isoamyl acetate. They then used the revolutionary gene-editing tool <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2020/10/07/a-tool-for-editing-genomes-wins-the-nobel-prize-for-chemistry">CRISPR-Cas9</a> to insert this mutation into another commercial yeast to make a superior strain, producing more banana flavour. Leave it to the Belgians to go an extra mile for a better pint.</p>
<h3>Weekend Profile: Ron DeSantis, the man whom even hurricanes cannot batter</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As an undergraduate at Yale, Ron DeSantis captained the baseball team. Now Florida’s Republican governor has his mind on home runs of the political sort. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida">Hurricane Ian</a>, which hit his state on September 28th, has left more than 115 Floridians dead and caused up to $57bn in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/06/floridas-government-subsidises-people-living-in-hurricane-zones">insured losses</a>. That may make it the second-costliest hurricane to strike America, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But for Mr DeSantis the storm’s wreckage has brought political opportunity, and a chance to demonstrate managerial know-how.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday he appeared alongside Joe Biden, whom he often criticises, as the president surveyed the damage. This time it was all comity. Mr DeSantis thanked him for providing federal aid; Mr Biden said that they had worked “hand in glove”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Disaster management has revealed a fresh side to the governor. Until recently he seemed more interested in lobbing bombs in America’s culture wars. In April, after Disney criticised a state <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/30/why-florida-is-banning-lessons-on-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity">ban on the discussion of sexuality and gender orientation</a> among young children in public-school classrooms, Mr DeSantis hit back. He hastily signed a law <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/what-ron-desantiss-spat-with-disney-says-about-american-politics/21808962">revoking Disney’s “special-district” status</a>, which for decades had allowed the media giant to operate much like a county government at its complex in central Florida. Hammering Democrats for their <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall">perceived weakness on border security</a> is another preoccupation. In September Mr DeSantis chartered private planes with state funds to send Venezuelan migrants in San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, in Massachusetts, an enclave for the wealthy liberals Mr DeSantis loves to taunt.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Those stunts—along with his aversion to lockdowns during the pandemic—have endeared the governor to conservatives. Mr DeSantis is now viewed as a potential rival to Donald Trump, a fellow Florida resident, for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2024. He has fashioned himself in a similar vein, emphasising issues such as election “integrity” and border security, but carries none of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in">former president’s baggage</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ironically it was Mr Trump’s surprise endorsement that helped Mr DeSantis take the governor’s mansion in 2018. That race was close enough to prompt a recount. In November he is expected to breeze to re-election—he commands an 11-point lead over his opponent, Charlie Crist. Now Mr DeSantis is focused on raising his national profile. Hurricane Ian has let him do just that.</p>
