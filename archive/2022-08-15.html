<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> unexpectedly reduced two signal interest rates, as policymakers try to inject oomph into an economy <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/05/26/how-xi-jinping-is-damaging-chinas-economy">weighted down</a> by the country’s strict zero-covid policy. The medium-term lending rate was lowered by a tenth of a percentage point, to 2.75%—its first cut since January. At the same time China’s statistics bureau disclosed disappointing new data: the rates of retail-sales growth and industrial production both slowed in July, year-on-year. Meanwhile, <strong>Japan </strong>grew by an annualised 2.2% in the past quarter, as it slightly relaxed its covid restrictions.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine</strong> said that <strong>Russia</strong> was unsuccessfully trying to advance on several towns in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. It reported heavy shelling and “fierce fighting” in the region, which has been a key focus of Russia’s invasion. Shelling was also reported in the Kherson region, where Ukraine is attempting a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/14/a-ukrainian-counter-offensive-in-kherson-faces-steep-odds">counter-offensive</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China’s </strong>army said it had organised military drills in the sea and airspace around <strong>Taiwan</strong>, in response to a group of American politicians visiting the island. The members of Congress are visiting Taiwan two weeks after a trip by Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of their House of Representatives, caused a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations">diplomatic rumpus</a> between America, China and Taiwan. Ed Markey, the Democrat leading the five-person delegation, said he wanted to encourage “peace across the Taiwan Strait”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Iran’s </strong>foreign ministry said that <strong>Salman Rushdie</strong> and his supporters were solely to blame for the attack on Mr Rushdie in New York on Friday. A spokesman said that “no one has the right to accuse Iran” of responsibility. In 1989 Iran issued a fatwa calling on Muslims to kill the novelist. Hadi Matar, the 24-year-old accused of attempted murder, pled not guilty on Saturday.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia</strong> pledged to foster closer ties with <strong>North Korea</strong>.

Earlier, it had seemed that Raila Odinga, the opposition candidate endorsed by Uhuru Kenyatta, the outgoing president, was in the lead. The counting has been slow, and some officials have scuffled amid high nerves.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Germany’s</strong> energy-network regulator said the country must <strong>cut gas use</strong> by 20% to avoid shortages this winter.

<h3>India marks 75 years of independence</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Atop the Red Fort in Delhi on Monday, Narendra Modi inaugurated the 75th anniversary of India’s independence with time-worn theatrics, declaring that with another 25 years it shall become “a developed country”. Yet, for such a big birthday, this year’s celebration will be relatively muted. Not because there is nothing to celebrate: the rupee’s power may be at a low, but Mr Modi’s is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/07/07/indias-ruling-party-wins-control-of-its-richest-state">consolidated</a> as never before and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/05/13/the-indian-economy-is-being-rewired-the-opportunity-is-immense">some economic indicators</a> are perking up. But for Mr Modi, looking back is awkward. He has a long record of disparaging the republic’s early decades, suggesting that its previous leaders accepted both European and Islamic influence too readily. Only his own “New India” is to command applause.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">One new thing for this anniversary is a government-organised campaign called <em>har ghar tiranga</em>, or “a flag in every home”. The Hindu-nationalist organisation where Mr Modi started his career once loathed the national tricolour (which nods to Islam as well as to Hinduism). But while the flag is now fully in vogue, India’s founding principle of pluralism is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/05/14/how-narendra-modi-is-remaking-india-into-a-hindu-state">under attack</a>: under Mr Modi’s leadership, Islamophobia has proliferated.</p>
<h3>A year of the Taliban</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Monday marks <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/11/afghanistan-is-poorer-and-hungrier-than-a-year-ago">one year</a> since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. In that time, the economy has collapsed as foreign powers have restricted aid and cut Afghanistan off from the global banking system. And the Taliban are back to ruling with theocratic tyranny. Men are harassed for trimming their beards. Girls are barred from secondary school. New rules dictate that women should only leave home when “necessary”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet there is a group of Afghans who are in one sense better off than they were a year ago. Villagers who lived on the frontlines of the conflict, in provinces such as Helmand and Kandahar, are safer than they have been in years. A new report by Crisis Group, a think-tank, suggests violent incidents in the ten months to mid-July were down 87% compared with the same period a year earlier. As winners and losers emerge, though, the question is whether that stability will last.</p>
<h3>Russia’s war Olympics</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Few Western countries will attend this year’s Moscow Conference on International Security, which begins on Monday. Instead, Russia has invited representatives from China, India and a host of other countries from across Africa, Asia and Latin America to hear its vision of a “multilateral” world, free from America’s yoke. The audience may be receptive: globally, 28 countries lean towards <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/04/04/who-are-russias-supporters">supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>, while a further 32 have remained neutral.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For the first time the annual event also coincides with two military extravaganzas. The Army 2022 forum is a chance to sell Russian weapons; 45 defence contracts worth $6.8bn were signed at the last exhibition, according to Russian state media. The Russian-founded International Army Games are a more sporting affair. Military personnel from countries such as China and Iran compete in combat exercises, including a “tank biathlon”. Russia’s army might do better to focus on the actual fighting in Ukraine, where it faces the possibility of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/14/a-ukrainian-counter-offensive-in-kherson-faces-steep-odds">counter-offensive</a> in the occupied city of Kherson.</p>
<h3>Britain’s never-ending crises</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Britons have spent yet another weekend sweltering in a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/09/julys-heatwave-may-have-killed-thousands-of-britons">heatwave</a>. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/12/british-farmers-face-up-to-the-prospect-of-drought">drought</a> is afflicting large parts of the country. But the thought of what is coming this winter is grabbing even more attention. Life is increasingly <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/11/britains-economy-is-taking-a-drubbing">unaffordable</a>, and energy prices help explain why.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Bank of England predicts that annual inflation will rise to around 13% this October. At least half of this increase will be driven by soaring energy prices. Estimates from Cornwall Insight, a consultancy, suggest that households’ average annual energy bills could grow from £1,971 ($2,380) now to £4,427 in April.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Talk of how to tackle the crisis has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/07/21/the-choice-between-rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss">dominated the race</a> to lead the Conservative Party—and to be the next prime minister. On Monday Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour party, laid out his own proposals for alleviating the pain, including a ban on raising energy prices. No politician has yet got ahead of the problem of surging bills. Despite the current heat, the prospect of winter is chilling.</p>
<h3>Edward Gardner and the Bergen Philharmonic</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Big bands can thrive in small towns. The Norwegian port of Bergen, despite its population of just 280,000, outplays much grander cities in the musical arena. The Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra had a solid reputation when Edward Gardner, an English conductor, arrived in 2015. Since then, its global renown has soared. On Monday Mr Gardner and his ensemble will appear at the Edinburgh International Festival. After performing Richard Strauss’s decadent musical drama “Salome” (the BPO regularly dazzle in modern opera), <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2020/06/16/vikingur-olafsson-is-revitalising-classical-music">Vikingur Olafsson</a>, an Icelandic pianist, will join them as soloist.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The orchestra has burnished Mr Gardner’s career. In 2019 the London Philharmonic Orchestra appointed him as its principal conductor. And when his time in Bergen ends in 2024, he will not abandon Norway: in February he was named as the next music director of the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet. Mr Gardner has made plain his love of his adopted musical home. In Norway, he has said, he learned “to love the importance of an artistic institution being embedded within a community”. </p>
