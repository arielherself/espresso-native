<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Liz Cheney</strong>, Wyoming’s incumbent congresswoman, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/17/liz-cheney-is-vanquished-by-donald-trump">conceded</a> to <strong>Harriet Hageman</strong> in the state’s Republican primary race. The daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/06/high-noon-for-liz-cheney">earned her party’s opprobrium</a> for investigating Donald Trump’s role in the Capitol riot and for voting to impeach him. The result offers yet more evidence of the stranglehold Mr Trump retains on his party. Of the ten Republican members of Congress who tried to hold him to account for the uprising, only two have prevailed against pro-Trump challengers.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine</strong> hinted that its forces were responsible for Tuesday’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/11/wrecked-planes-smoulder-at-russias-saky-airbase-in-crimea" data-tegid="ug5331iijp1kpspd9l56atlqsl0uc37d">explosions at a military base</a> in <strong>Russian-occupied Crimea</strong>, located far from the war’s frontlines. A presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, predicted more such attacks. Separately, the self-proclaimed leader of the breakaway Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine pledged to develop “equally beneficial bilateral co-operation” in a letter to<strong> North Korea</strong>, which in July became the third country in the world to recognise the separatist-controlled region’s independence.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Turkey</strong> agreed to restore full diplomatic ties, ending a long standoff.

The announcement from Hardeep Singh Puri, the minister for housing and urban affairs, was vague on what was meant by “round-the-clock” police protection. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs contradicted Mr Puri’s statement, writing on Twitter that it has not given any directions to house the “illegal foreigners”.</p>

The Bank of England has forecast that inflation may reach 13% by autumn.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Uniper</strong>, a German utility firm, reported a staggering loss of €12.4bn ($12.6bn) for the first half of 2022, pointing to Europe’s worsening energy crisis. The company, which is Germany’s largest importer of Russian gas, attributes over half of its net loss to the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/07/14/can-deutschland-ag-cope-with-the-russian-gas-shock">reduced gas flows</a>, which have forced it to cover the shortfall in the spot market at higher prices.

<h3>America’s resilient housing market</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When house prices are rising homeowners are more likely to spruce up their properties, according to Marvin Ellison, the CEO of Lowe’s. That insight was confirmed by the home-improvement store’s better-than-expected results on Wednesday. The company saw only a slight decrease in annual sales as in recent months America’s<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/01/the-global-housing-boom-is-running-out-of-steam"> housing boom ended</a>. The question now is whether the world’s largest housing market will turn to bust. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The buying frenzy has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/01/the-global-housing-boom-is-running-out-of-steam">certainly slowed</a>. Uncertainty among builders is mounting: on Tuesday, data showed that the number of house-building projects started in July was 9.6% lower than in June. Yet there is little sign that a crash is on the way. An analysis by <em>The Economist</em> of 900 metro areas in America finds that prices have fallen in just six since the beginning of the year. And on Tuesday the earnings of Home Depot, a competitor of Lowe’s, beat expectations. The party is less raucous, it seems, but it has not yet ended.</p>
<h3>Resuscitating the Iran nuclear deal</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Until recently the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action looked <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/02/the-zombie-nuclear-deal">beyond salvage</a>. Now there is a glimmer of hope for the revival of the nuclear deal that was signed by Iran and six world powers in 2015, and abandoned by Donald Trump in 2018. Last week the European Union circulated a “final text” and demanded Iran reply to it by Monday. To everyone’s relief, it did. Mohammad Marandi, an adviser to Iran’s negotiating team, sounded upbeat. “The remaining issues are not very difficult to resolve”, he tweeted.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">That remains to be seen. Iran wants the International Atomic Energy Agency, a UN watchdog, to shut down its probe into the country’s past illicit nuclear activity, despite many unanswered questions. It also wants to be sure that it will feel the benefit of sanctions relief. Western diplomats worry that Iran is eking out talks while continuing to expand its nuclear programme. Two weeks ago Iran began feeding fresh uranium gas into hundreds of new centrifuges. A deal may be in sight, but it is not yet in hand.</p>
<h3>Tencent fails to escape China’s techlash</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Tencent, the world’s largest gaming firm, is still in the line of fire at home. On Wednesday the “League of Legends” owner reported its first ever quarterly sales decline, partly as a result of Chinese regulators’ refusal to grant it new gaming licences. Its woes mainly stemmed from the Chinese government’s crackdown on tech, which caused an unprecedented slump in video-gaming revenues in China in the first half of the year. Tencent’s other businesses struggled, too: a slowing economy and lockdowns hurt advertising on WeChat, its social-media platform.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Tencent’s response has been to slim down in China. Having shed a stake in JD.com, an e-commerce giant, it reportedly may sell its $24bn stake in Meituan, a food-delivery firm. To compensate it intends to expand abroad, perhaps by investing in firms such as Ubisoft, a French video-game maker, to add to its array of foreign gaming interests. But Tencent must tread carefully. Western governments are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/11/tencent-is-a-success-story-bedevilled-by-the-splinternet">increasingly cautious</a> about Chinese firms making foreign acquisitions.</p>
<h3>How to invest Norway’s oil and gas revenues</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Norway has its own Davos, called Arendalsuka. Being Scandinavian, the festival is less about globalisation or high finance than about strengthening democracy. But one outfit reported its half-year earnings at the event on Wednesday: the state-owned <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2021/12/04/managing-the-worlds-biggest-sovereign-wealth-fund-is-about-to-get-complicated">Norwegian oil fund</a>. With investments in about 9,300 companies around the world, the market value of the fund is around 12.3tr Norwegian kroner ($1.26trn), making it one of the largest anywhere.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But its results for 2022 have not been good. Returns on the fund dropped by a record 14.4%, nearly wiping out the fund’s gains from last year. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, Norway’s government instructed the fund to divest its many Russian holdings. It has also had to grapple with inflation and higher interest rates. Technology stocks fared particularly poorly amid global recession fears. But the fund could still ride out the sell-off across sectors thanks to a boost from its energy holdings, which increased in value by 13% as prices for oil and gas continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Lithuania celebrates the Karaims</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">One of Europe’s smallest minority populations, the Karaims, are being celebrated in Lithuania this year. On Wednesday Karolina Cicha, a folk musician, will perform in Trakai, a city in south-east Lithuania that has historically been home to the Karaims. The fact that Ms Cicha is actually Polish will do little to dampen the party.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Who are the Karaims? At some point around the 14th century—1397, according to the Lithuanian parliament, who thought the 625th anniversary was as good a reason as any to celebrate—Vytautas, the grand duke of Lithuania, invited them from Crimea, to serve as bodyguards and traders. Some also went to Poland. Today there are only a few hundred Karaims left in each country.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But unlike many minorities, the Karaims have been welcomed in their adopted homes. Launching the year of celebrations in May Ingrida Simonyte, Lithuania’s prime minister, said that the Karaims were a “unique treasure” who enriched the country’s present and future.</p>
