<p class="customisedFont"><strong>American</strong> officials said that they were preparing a new weapons package worth $1.1bn for <strong>Ukraine</strong> and—if Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of Ukrainian territory—another round of sanctions against <strong>Russia</strong>. The results of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/27/in-fake-referendums-occupied-parts-of-ukraine-vote-to-join-russia">sham referendums</a> held in four Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine are expected in the next couple of days, and seem a foregone conclusion: officials there have claimed that residents voted overwhelmingly to join Russia. Meanwhile several European countries are investigating leaks from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/02/22/the-west-imposes-swift-sanctions-on-russia-can-they-stop-a-war">major gas pipelines</a>, which Russia has been accused of sabotaging, under the Baltic sea. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Cuba’s</strong> entire population of 11m was plunged into a blackout after <strong>Hurricane Ian</strong> swept through, forcing 50,000 people to flee their homes.

<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>IMF</strong> urged <strong>Britain’s</strong> government to “re-evaluate” its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically">new fiscal policy</a>, which triggered a collapse in the value of sterling after it was announced last week. The global lender reckons the “untargeted” measures, which include £45bn ($48bn) of debt-funded tax cuts, will worsen inflation and increase inequality. Earlier, the <strong>Bank of England’s</strong> chief economist had said the package would require a “s<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/27/the-fallout-from-kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-continues">ignificant monetary response</a>”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>pound </strong>bounced back from its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/26/the-pound-is-plumbing-near-historical-depths-why">record low</a> against the mighty <strong>dollar</strong>, having fallen briefly below $1.04 on Monday, to hover around 1.07. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/the-dollar-is-as-strong-as-ever-isnt-it">greenback</a> continued to run riot around the world. The euro sank further beneath parity, to 96 cents. And China’s <strong>offshore yuan</strong> plumbed an all-time low, at less than 7.2 per buck or 12% cheaper than it started the year.</p>

<p class="customisedFont">Officials in <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> said around 98,000 <strong>Russians</strong> have crossed their shared border since Vladimir Putin announced a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation">partial mobilisation</a>. Last week Mr Putin declared that around 300,000 men were needed on the frontline of his war in Ukraine; some 250,000 have since left Russia. Meanwhile <strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, Ukraine’s president, urged other leaders to take “preventive” action, rather than wait to “react” to Russia’s latest escalation.</p>

Biogen and Eisai announced that their new medicine had reduced the disease’s progression by 27% compared with a placebo. Previous attempts to treat Alzheimer’s with drugs have been beset by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/07/23/critical-research-on-the-causes-of-alzheimers-may-have-been-falsified">high-profile failures</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Saudi Arabia’s</strong> king appointed his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, as prime minister, a role traditionally held by the monarch.

<h3>Japan’s controversial state funeral</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Last week world leaders gathered at Westminster Abbey to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II. On Tuesday many of them flocked to the other side of the world to attend the state funeral in Tokyo of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/26/the-fallout-from-abe-shinzos-murder-could-unseat-his-successor">Abe Shinzo</a>, a former Japanese prime minister, who was assassinated in July. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Japan’s current prime minister, Kishida Fumio, hopes the event will boost the country’s presence on the global stage. But the plan has been hugely unpopular among Japanese thanks to Abe’s controversial <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/07/14/abe-shinzo-left-his-mark-on-asia-and-the-world-not-just-japan">legacy</a>, which includes downplaying the nation’s wartime atrocities, and the cost, estimated at about ¥1.66bn ($11.8m). A poll in mid-September by <em>Nikkei</em>, a media giant, found that only 33% of the public favoured holding the funeral. It also revealed that the approval rating for Mr Kishida’s government had plunged from 57% in August to 43%. Protests are expected across the country.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Rumours abound that such opposition could push the government into holding a snap election this autumn. Conversely, once the funeral is over and the Japanese have witnessed global dignitaries paying tribute to Abe, that opposition might fade.</p>
<h3>Russia’s nuclear blackmail</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Western officials have grown increasingly concerned about the risk that Russia, facing severe setbacks on the battlefield, might resort to the use of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict">nuclear weapons</a> in Ukraine. Russia is annexing large parts of occupied Ukraine through sham referendums, perhaps as early as Tuesday. President Vladimir Putin has argued that Ukrainian attacks on these territories would thus constitute attacks on Russian soil, and has hinted at nuclear retaliation to protect the country’s “territorial integrity”. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and key ally of Mr Putin, reiterated on Tuesday that Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons and this was certainly “not a bluff”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">How seriously should these threats be taken? Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has said that he doesn’t think Mr <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-vows-to-send-more-invaders-the-west-should-arm-ukraine-faster">Putin is</a> bluffing. Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, has said that his government has warned Russia that nuclear use would have “catastrophic consequences”. American officials say that these could include conventional military strikes against Russia. But if Russia were to respond in kind, the result would be a shooting war between NATO and Russia—the very thing the two sides have sought to avoid ever since Mr Putin’s ill-fated invasion. </p>
<h3>The reinvention of BlackBerry</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">BlackBerry, the Canadian manufacturer of a once-iconic messaging accessory used by business people with dextrous thumbs, has been in decline for more than a decade. Its reluctance to replace the devices’ fiddly buttons with touchscreens, and its failure to embrace apps, ceded the smartphone market to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/07/31/apple-already-sold-everyone-an-iphone-now-what">Apple</a> and Android. The firm stopped making its handsets in 2020, and finally ceased support for them this year. Since then it has tried to reinvent itself as a maker of business software. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In its quarterly results due on Tuesday, analysts hope for evidence of a successful turnaround. BlackBerry’s cybersecurity business, including antivirus software and secure mobile apps, is growing slowly but steadily. More promising is its booming <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/technology-quarterly/2019/09/12/the-internet-of-things-will-bring-the-internets-business-model-into-the-rest-of-the-world">Internet of Things</a> business; BlackBerry software is embedded in 215m vehicles and various other bits of machinery. Could it eventually turn a profit? One day, perhaps, but expect it to announce another loss-making quarter first.</p>
<h3>Britain’s economy takes a pounding</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Investors are still reeling from Kwasi Kwarteng’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically">fiscal statement</a> last Friday, when the new British finance minister breezily announced the biggest tax cuts in half a century, along with measures that will increase borrowing by 3% of GDP this year. After weekend reports of yet more fiscal largesse to come, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/26/the-pound-is-plumbing-near-historical-depths-why">pound</a> dropped to a record low against the dollar in the early hours of Monday, before recovering some ground. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday the government will feel the consequences of its actions further, when it tries to borrow £1.2bn ($1.3bn) in inflation-linked gilts maturing in 2031. At 9am on September 23rd the market interest rate for unlinked gilts was 3.46%, but by close of play on Monday it had climbed to<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://markets.ft.com/data/bonds/tearsheet/charts?s=UK10YG"> 4.1</a>%. On Sunday Mr Kwarteng declined to comment on short-term market moves, claiming that he was focusing on growth. But unless something changes to bolster investors’ trust, the clamour to change course will be hard to ignore.</p>
<h3>“Silent Spring” and modern environmentalism</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Sixty years ago on Tuesday, Rachel Carson’s book <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/09/27/silent-spring-remains-a-rousing-call-to-action">“Silent Spring”</a> was published. Combining rigorous scientific analysis with lyrical prose, Carson, an aquatic biologist at America’s department of fisheries, detailed the extensive damage DDT and other such insecticides wreaked on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2021/06/02/cicadas-insecticides-and-children">ecosystems</a>. The chemical industry tried to sue, also attacking Carson’s scientific credentials (she did not have a PhD) and personal life. Undeterred, President John F. Kennedy ordered his scientific advisory committee to investigate. DDT was banned in America in 1972.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Influential figures from Al Gore, a former American vice-president, to Rex Weyler, a co-founder of Greenpeace International, credit Carson, who died in 1964, with inspiring their <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/04/16/in-chilly-parts-of-europe-heatwaves-strengthen-environmentalism">environmental campaigning</a>. Sir David Attenborough, a British naturalist, describes “Silent Spring” as the book which, after “On the Origin of Species”, has most profoundly shaped the scientific world. Carson’s legacy further endures in environmental literature, influencing writers such as Robert Macfarlane. In Margaret Atwood’s novel “The Year of the Flood”, the feast day of Saint Rachel Carson is celebrated. Though not a saint, Carson was certainly a herald.</p>
