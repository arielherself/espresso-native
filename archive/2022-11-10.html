<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s </strong>annual <strong>inflation</strong> rate slowed to 7.7% in October, the lowest since January and below forecasts. Down from 8.2% in September, the cooling rate offers hope that some of America’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/19/why-inflation-refuses-to-go-away">steepest price increases in decades</a> are easing. Investors were cheered by hopes that the Federal Reserve’s tightening will relax: the S&amp;P 500 leapt by over 4% and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite by more than 5%.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Joe Biden</strong> and <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> will meet in person on Monday, for the first time as presidents of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/america-and-china-must-talk">America and China</a>. The meeting will take place ahead of the G20 summit in Bali. In a statement the White House suggested the pair will discuss efforts to “maintain and deepen lines of communication” between America and China, as well as how to work together on “transnational challenges”. Earlier, Russian officials confirmed that President Vladimir Putin would not attend the G20 summit.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukrainian</strong> troops pushed further towards the city of <strong>Kherson</strong> after <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/09/russia-says-it-is-abandoning-the-ukrainian-city-of-kherson">Russia said it would withdraw</a> from the occupied regional capital. Ukraine’s forces recaptured 12 surrounding villages and towns including Snihurivka. Yet the country’s army chief said he could still not confirm that Russia was pulling out of Kherson city. Earlier, a high-level Ukrainian official said he saw “no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Control of <strong>America’s Senate</strong> is on a knife edge after Tuesday’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/09/the-democrats-have-done-better-than-expected">midterm elections</a>, with 48 of 100 seats currently held by each party. Georgia’s election will go to a run-off next month. The Democrats <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/09/the-democrats-have-done-better-than-expected">need to win</a> two of the three competitive seats yet to be called (the others being Arizona and Nevada) to keep their majority. The <strong>House of Representatives</strong> is likely to flip to the Republicans, but the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/07/why-a-republican-ripple-is-more-likely-than-a-red-wave">“red wave”</a> they anticipated did not materialise.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, founder of <strong>FTX</strong>, the world’s third-largest crypto exchange, <strong>apologised</strong> for the near-collapse of his firm. In a series of tweets Mr <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/05/cryptos-last-man-standing">Bankman-Fried</a> vowed to repay users of FTX, which has faced a liquidity crunch and financial difficulties. On Wednesday Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, withdrew from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried">talks to buy out FTX</a>, sending crypto prices crashing. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The head of the United Nations Development Programme told delegates at <strong>COP27</strong> that more than 50 of the world’s poorest countries were at risk of defaulting on their debt and needed urgent assistance to cope with the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the heads of several African governments said that they must be allowed to use fossil fuels to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/03/africa-will-remain-poor-unless-it-uses-more-energy">lift their countries out of poverty</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Israeli archeologists deciphered what might be the <strong>oldest written sentence</strong>: “May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard.” It was scratched onto an ivory comb that was unearthed six years ago; the words were only recently noticed. This ancient wisdom was engraved in the Canaanite script, the first known alphabet, which dates from 2100-1500 BC.</p>

<h3>What the midterms mean for business</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Corporate America likes gridlock. So although the<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/15/republicans-are-falling-out-of-love-with-america-inc"> Republican Party</a> did worse than expected in the midterms, assuming they take the House, business executives will not be moping. Divided government means no new corporation taxes or windfall levies from the Biden administration. It also means less public spending. That may help limit the rise in inflation<strong>—</strong>which data out on Thursday showed slowed slightly, to 7.7% annually in October. Thankfully for some industries, big spending bills on infrastructure, semiconductors and climate have already become law, meaning there is still plenty of money to feast upon.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America Inc will not be spared from heavy-handed government, though. The GOP will lack the strength in Congress to thwart the White House’s efforts to push regulation to the left. And while Washington, DC, is in legislative paralysis, state governments will flex their muscles. These are increasingly ideological strongholds, and growing bossier towards business. Red states attack corporate “wokeness” while blue states demand environmental purity. There are big chasms for the private sector to straddle.</p>
<h3>Russia abandons Kherson</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Thursday morning may seem like a new dawn for residents of Kherson, a city in southern Ukraine. Almost immediately after Russia invaded on February 24th there was heavy fighting in Kherson; its forces captured the city on March 2nd, and have held it ever since. In September, after a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/27/vladimir-putin-stages-four-fake-referendums-in-occupied-ukraine">sham referendum</a>, the Kremlin illegally annexed Kherson province. But on Wednesday Russian officials announced a full military withdrawal from Kherson city and the area west of the Dnieper river.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The physical withdrawal will not happen instantaneously—retreating under fire is one of the most challenging tasks any army can undertake. Many Ukrainians are sceptical that Russia is really prepared to go without a fight; some fear a ruse. Yet the public admission that its position there is untenable and must now be abandoned is a huge blow to Russia’s army. Kherson city was one of the few prizes that Russia had kept in eight months of war. It is also a huge opportunity for Ukrainian forces. Moving back into the city will bring parts of Crimea within range of longer-range rocket artillery.</p>
<h3>The Republican Party after the midterms</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As votes in America’s midterms continue to be counted, the Republicans look likely to narrowly <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/09/30/what-would-republicans-do-with-a-majority-in-the-house-of-representatives">win</a> the House of Representatives. Control of the Senate may not be known for weeks, as the race in Georgia goes to a December run-off. The results were <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/09/the-democrats-have-done-better-than-expected">closer than expected</a>. But a few portents stand out.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Republicans may have to temper their anti-abortion rhetoric. Voters chose to protect reproductive rights in a handful of states. Same for their denial of the 2020 election: many proponents of the “Big Lie” <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/09/many-republican-election-deniers-lost-their-statewide-races">lost statewide races</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In Washington, a Republican-controlled House will do little legislating and hold more made-for-television hearings. Unless Democrats raise the debt ceiling in the lame-duck session, Republicans may try to hold America’s credit rating (and the global economy) hostage to force spending concessions. And a narrow Republican majority would give the party’s far-right flank relatively greater power, meaning headaches for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/kevin-mccarthys-accidental-truthfulness/21808964">Kevin McCarthy</a>, the presumptive Speaker. The next few months promise political deadlock—back to familiar territory.</p>
<h3>Britain’s winter of discontent</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday many commuters in London once again struggled to get to work. Staff from London Underground, which runs the Tube network, are striking over pay and conditions. And around Britain, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/03/britain-faces-a-wave-of-industrial-action-this-winter">more industrial action</a> is coming. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday the Royal College of Nursing announced that its 300,000 members had voted for the union’s first ever national strike. Staff at 150 universities will walk out at the end of November. Teachers, midwives and ambulance workers are all mulling similar measures. Some rail strikes were suspended this week, but if unions’ negotiations with bosses fail, they could come back. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Unions’ chief demand is for pay rises to reflect inflation, which reached a 40-year high of 10% in September. The government, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/27/rishi-sunak-britains-new-prime-minister-starts-on-the-defensive">scrambling to patch up its finances</a>, seems unlikely to comply with such demands. Britain is braced for a season of disruption.</p>
<h3>A billion-dollar art auction</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Co-founding Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975 eventually made Paul Allen a billionaire many times over. Much of this fortune was spent on environmental, scientific and philanthropic endeavours. Some of it paid for yachts and sumptuous villas. And Allen, who <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2018/10/18/paul-allen-leaves-a-lasting-legacy-both-at-microsoft-and-in-seattle">died in 2018</a>, also accumulated a particularly fine art collection. Mixing contemporary works with 19th-century masterpieces, its treasures include a pointilliste painting by Georges Seurat, a landscape of Mont Sainte-Victoire by Paul Cézanne, a self-portrait by Francis Bacon and one of J.M.W. Turner’s finest vistas of the Redentore church in Venice. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Allen’s rationale for collecting was admiration rather than investment. “You have to be doing it because you just love the works,” he insisted. The first part of his collection was sold at an auction on Wednesday evening, at Christie’s in New York, raising a record $1.5bn and making the sale the biggest single-owner art auction ever. The second part will be sold on Thursday. And there is more than $500m-worth still in the vaults.</p>
