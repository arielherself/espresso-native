A caucus of 20 hard-right Republicans had initially blocked his path, but a swathe of concessions, including allowing a single lawmaker to force a vote on ousting the speaker, eventually persuaded enough of them to drop their opposition.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There was little sign that a unilateral 36-hour <strong>ceasefire in Ukraine</strong>, announced by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/23/making-sense-of-vladimir-putins-war">the Kremlin</a> to mark Orthodox Christmas, was holding. On Saturday Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, praised the Russian Orthodox church for backing his “military operation”, as troops shelled the Ukrainian town of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/04/a-russian-warlords-savagery-is-sending-a-loud-message-to-moscow">Bakhmut</a>, near the most fiercely contested section of the front line.

America added 223,000 jobs last month, official statistics showed, compared with 256,000 in November. Still, the unemployment rate dipped from 3.6% to 3.5%. That means the Fed is likely to continue its aggressive monetary policy.</p>

<h3>Covid surveillance is faltering</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Three years ago this week scientists in China isolated the first strain of the novel coronavirus that would spawn the covid-19 pandemic. Again all eyes are on China: the country has stopped reporting reliable data on cases and deaths, just as it faces the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/01/05/china-is-overwhelmed-yet-an-even-bigger-covid-wave-may-be-coming">world’s biggest wave of infections</a>. That is stoking worries that if a scary new variant emerges there, other countries will be unaware until their hospitals fill up.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But variants can appear anywhere. More infections increase the chances of that, and covid is spreading freely around the world. About 2% of people in Britain, for example, had covid on any given day in recent months. The latest—and most contagious—offshoot of the Omicron variant, called XBB.1.5, probably originated in America. Sharing genomic sequences is the first step to dealing with new variants. But as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2023/01/04/all-around-the-world-covid-surveillance-is-faltering">countries abandon testing</a>, such surveillance is winding down. That is what the world should worry about most.</p>
<h3>Problems mount for Vladimir Putin</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">At midnight on Saturday, Russia’s purported temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, marking Orthodox Christmas, ended. In truth, the fighting never stopped. Vladimir Putin ordered the unilateral truce at the behest of Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/03/21/russias-orthodox-church-paints-the-conflict-in-ukraine-as-a-holy-war">fierce supporter of the president</a>. Mr Putin needs to keep his allies close amid his faltering invasion. The latest setback—a deadly <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/04/a-russian-warlords-savagery-is-sending-a-loud-message-to-moscow">strike</a> on a Russian barracks in the Donetsk region that killed at least 89 soldiers—has brought more public criticism of Russia’s generals. And shadowy figures such as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/who-is-yevgeny-prigozhin-the-man-behind-the-wagner-group">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a>, the head of Wagner Group, a private militia, are gaining more influence on the battlefield as a result.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For now, Mr Prigozhin remains under Mr Putin’s thumb. But doubts about the president’s military acumen persist. Moreover, Ukraine insists that Russia will shortly launch another mobilisation in preparation for a large offensive. The first recruitment drive incited <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/29/protests-erupt-across-russia">widespread protests</a> in Russia in September. Repeating the move would chip away further at the president’s authority. </p>
<h3>Benin’s brittle democracy</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The people of Benin have had much to celebrate lately. Many of their centuries-old bronze sculptures, which were looted by the British in 1897, are being returned. But that will not assuage the worries of many Beninois—who vote in parliamentary elections on Sunday—about <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2021/04/08/benins-democratic-beacon-dims">growing cracks</a> in their achievement of helping to lead Africa’s wave of democratisation in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The last such election in 2019 was a sham: no opposition parties were on the ballot, leading to a woefully low turnout and days of violent protests. This time the Constitutional Court has allowed three such parties to run, though prominent opponents of Patrice Talon, the president since 2016, are still in jail on trumped-up charges. Mr Talon, who won re-election in a flawed presidential poll in 2021, promised at the time not to unconstitutionally seek a third term. But many Beninois will have noted his more recent assertions that authoritarian measures are necessary, and that democratic freedoms “flirt with anarchy”.</p>
<h3>South Africa’s new cricket league</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ever since the wildly successful Indian Premier League was launched in 2008, other cricketing nations have rushed to get their own tournament in the fast-paced <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2021/10/20/cricket-looks-set-to-become-a-global-game">Twenty20</a> (T20) format. In 2018 South Africa inaugurated its Mzansi Super League, but the tournament folded when the pandemic forced the crowds away. With covid-19 in abeyance, the country has decided that if you can’t beat <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/13/india-ought-to-win-crickets-twenty20-world-cup-but-probably-wont">India</a>, you may as well join it.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">And so on Tuesday, South Africa will launch SA20, a successor to the Super League with one big difference: all six teams are owned by IPL franchises, rather than private investors. South Africa hopes to draw on the Indian experience of running a lucrative league. But SA20 will have other competitors: the established T20 Big Bash League, ongoing in Australia, and another new league soon to begin in the United Arab Emirates. Whether fans crave yet more whirlwind cricket remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Weekend Profile: Andriy Kostin, Ukraine’s prosecutor with a plan</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Few would envy Andriy Kostin, Ukraine’s newish prosecutor-general. His office is short on armoured vehicles, bulletproof vests and kit to detect landmines, which he calls “a real threat” to his officers in the field. His office has nonetheless recorded more than 60,000 alleged Russian <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/04/08/as-russian-soldiers-retreat-they-leave-evidence-of-war-crimes">war crimes</a>, ranging from torture and executions to strikes on over 400 medical facilities. Allies have lent him investigators, but with only about 200 Ukrainian war-crimes prosecutors, the team is stretched thin. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">An inauspicious discovery led to Mr Kostin’s appointment, in July. His predecessor was dismissed after numerous prosecutorial officials were suspected of collaborating with Russia. But Mr Kostin, a law graduate of Odessa National University, is himself not entirely free of controversy. In 2021 Mr Kostin’s candidacy to lead an anti-corruption arm of the institution he now runs failed. Watchdogs saw “significant violations” in his ethical conduct, including two visits to occupied Crimea, failure to report a sale of real estate to a different anti-corruption body, and “possible nepotism”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Kostin now dismisses the matter as a “historical question”; in the present, he is crafting a bold agenda. He describes Russia’s war as genocide, noting that Russian officials have spoken of “de-Ukrainisation”. He says some 14,000 cases of Ukrainian children being forcibly taken to Russia and Belarus amount to “stealing” Ukraine’s future. Mr Kostin believes that most cases of Russian war crimes can be tried in Ukrainian courts. They have already convicted 21 people of war crimes, some in absentia. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">More ambitiously, Mr Kostin would also like to see Russia’s top leaders tried for aggression against Ukraine, but neither Ukraine nor the International Criminal Court have the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/04/04/how-if-at-all-might-russia-be-punished-for-its-war-crimes-in-ukraine">legal authority</a> to do so. Mr Kostin is therefore lobbying hard for the creation of a special international tribunal, possibly by a vote of the UN’s general assembly—no small undertaking. The tribunal’s priority would be to try Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Many countries will hesitate to lend support. But outrage over Russia’s war, Mr Kostin says, is steadily building the necessary political capital. If Mr Kostin succeeds, he will have made his mark on history.</p>
