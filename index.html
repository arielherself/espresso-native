<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukrainian forces</strong> struck the occupied city of <strong>Melitopol</strong> in the south-east with a missile barrage. Ukraine also reported that <strong>Russian drone</strong> attacks had severed power from all but the most critical infrastructure in the southern port city of <strong>Odessa</strong>. Both sides <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/30/what-is-the-war-in-ukraine-teaching-western-armies">need more arms</a>. Ukraine’s ambassador in Berlin told <em>Welt am Sonntag</em>, a newspaper, that Germany would send more ammunition and weaponry. Meanwhile, Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, said that his country was increasing arms production to protect itself from “enemies” in the West.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">One of the <strong>European Parliament’s </strong>14 elected vice-presidents was arrested by Belgian police on suspicion of having taken <strong>bribes </strong>from an unnamed country. Eva Kaili, a member of Greece’s centre-left coalition, was expelled by her party after police swept up cash worth about €600,000 ($632,000) in raids around Brussels. Unattributed sources told two Belgian outlets that Ms Kaili had been suborned by Qatar.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Tens of thousands of <strong>Bangaldeshis </strong>marched in Dhaka, the capital, calling for the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister, and for early elections. The demonstrations were organised by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which says the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/13/bangladesh-ramps-up-its-persecution-of-muhammad-yunus">government</a> has failed to tackle high fuel prices.

<h3>Artemis splashdown</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Sunday, if all goes well, a space capsule called Orion, with three human dummies on board—Commanders Moonikin Campos, Helga and Zohar, as well as a Snoopy doll—will splash down in the Pacific Ocean. Orion is all that is left of NASA’s first Artemis mission, part of its programme to return astronauts to the Moon.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">If Orion’s re-entry is a success, the next step will be a crewed lunar fly-by</p>
<p class="customisedFont">in 2024, followed by a crewed landing in 2025. For comparison, in the gung-ho 1960s, the time between the first uncrewed launch of a Saturn V and Neil Armstrong’s “One small step” was 20 months. Meanwhile, at SpaceX’s launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, preparations continue for the first orbital flight of Starship, a vehicle that should be able to replicate the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/11/16/the-worlds-most-pointless-rocket-has-been-launched-at-last">Space Launch System</a> on which Orion was carried into space, but at a tiny fraction of the cost.</p>
<h3>There’s a new mayor in Tinseltown</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In November Karen Bass became the first woman to be elected mayor of Los Angeles. On Sunday she will be sworn in. Kamala Harris, a fellow Angeleno and the first female vice-president, will administer the oath of office. It is a show of solidarity among two California politicians who once competed for the same job: both were shortlisted to become President Joe Biden’s veep.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Bass is no political neophyte. She spent five years in the state legislature and more than ten in the House of Representatives. But running LA is a different kind of challenge. America’s second-biggest city is reeling after <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/13/leaked-audio-from-las-city-council-holds-a-warning-for-democrats">a leaked tape</a> exposed the racism of city council members, and voters are frustrated by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/08/02/the-pandemic-has-made-homelessness-more-visible-in-many-american-cities">worsening homelessness</a>. Ms Bass promised to declare a state of emergency to tackle the latter issue. The LA native said she wanted to be mayor to help fix her hometown. Angelenos will hope she succeeds.</p>
<h3>TikTok’s growing influence in the music industry</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For a platform dominated by Generation Z, golden oldies do surprisingly well on TikTok. Among the video-sharing app’s most popular songs in America this year, a list of which was released this week, is Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)”, from 1985. The song owes its resurgence to the Netflix show “Stranger Things”; it provided the soundtrack to over 2.6m TikTok videos this year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">It’s not the first time that a vintage tune has resurfaced on the app. In 2020 Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” re-entered streaming charts after appearing in a viral video of a man skateboarding to the song while calmly drinking a bottle of cranberry juice. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">TikTok has become integral to how artists promote their music. For fresh faces, gaining popularity on the platform is often a ticket to a record deal. But they face stiff competition from the stars of their parents’ generation.</p>
<h3>World’s oldest DNA reveals Ice Age ecosystem</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">DNA samples can reveal much about the lives of ancient animals. But new research published in <em>Nature, </em>a journal, shows how environmental DNA can illuminate whole ecosystems, too. Scientists harvested eDNA from sediment thawed from permafrost in northern Greenland. Unlike genetic material from one animal, eDNA is the microscopic spoor of many different species, including plants and micro-organisms. Scientists, tooled with computing power and libraries of present-day species’ genomes, used it to reconstruct an ecosystem from the Ice Age.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The 2m-year-old ecosystem was home to birch trees, geese, lemmings, reindeer and even mastodons, an extinct elephantine creature. This astonishingly complete snapshot could hold clues about how ecosystems adapt to extreme conditions, as the climate of that epoch resembles that predicted under future warming. The project also expands how far back in time DNA hunting can reach. Not only at the poles, but also in Africa, where the clay may contain genetic material from early man.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s likely new national security minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">At age 19, Itamar Ben-Gvir was Israel’s most toxic political activist. He had been the leader of the youth wing of the far-right, anti-Arab Kach party when the Israeli government designated it a terrorist organisation in 1994. A year later he was tainted by the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He had no part in the murder, by a Jewish extremist furious about Rabin’s attempts to compromise with the Palestinians. But weeks earlier Mr Ben-Gvir had vandalised the prime minister’s car and boasted on television that “we got to his car, we’ll get to him too.” </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Now aged 46, Mr Ben-Gvir will soon be made national security minister in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics">incoming government of Binyamin Netanyahu</a>. He was once considered too dangerous to be conscripted into the army; now he will lead Israel’s police, which previously investigated him for inciting violence. To many, his rehabilitation symbolises the hard-right turn of Israeli politics.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Ben-Gvir’s mission has been to make palatable a movement regarded by nearly all Israelis as beyond the pale. Raised in an affluent suburb near Jerusalem, he moved to a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. He opened a law practice that specialised in representing radical Jews accused of anti-Arab terrorism. He joined another party, Jewish Power, on a platform softened just enough to comply with rules prohibiting political parties from inciting racism. After years of leading groups of thugs in the streets of Jerusalem crying “Death to the Arabs!” he began correcting them to shout “Death to the terrorists!” instead.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the rebranding wasn’t enough: in 2020 the party received only 19,000 votes. Its salvation came from Mr Netanyahu, who in his quest for a right-wing majority pressured Jewish Power to merge its candidate list with those of two other far-right parties. The new “Religious Zionism” list, which Mr Ben-Gvir co-leads, won 14 seats at the election in November, making it a critical part of Mr Netanyahu’s coalition.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Ben-Gvir is trying to project a more moderate image, promising that as security minister “we will make sure law-abiding Arabs are secure as well”. But his election-night message revealed his long-held beliefs: “It’s time for us to return to being the landlords of our country.”</p>
