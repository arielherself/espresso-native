<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, the Soviet Union’s last leader, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/08/30/mikhail-gorbachev-last-leader-of-the-soviet-union" data-tegid="2ohh0p9sgemejnpt46jc40j9fstiu4fa">died in hospital in Moscow</a>, aged 91. As president he launched a set of policies known as <em>perestroika </em>and <em>glasnost</em>, aimed at opening the Soviet economy and democratising its politics. Mr Gorbachev also <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2017/08/31/how-mikhail-gorbachev-ended-the-cold-war">cultivated warmer relations with the West</a> and supported communist reformers in central and eastern Europe. He won the Nobel peace prize in 1990, and reluctantly watched the Soviet Union collapse in 1991.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine</strong> claimed to have destroyed bridges across the Dnieper river in its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/29/ukraine-starts-a-push-to-recapture-kherson-a-crucial-russian-occupied-city">counter-offensive</a> in the Russian-occupied region of <strong>Kherson</strong>, and to have pushed into the eastern front as well. Meanwhile, UN inspectors set out from Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, to visit the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant">Zaporizhia nuclear plant</a>, though Ukrainian officials accused Russia of trying to sabotage the mission. At a meeting in Prague, European Union defence ministers considered a proposal to train Ukrainian troops, which America, Britain and several EU countries are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/25/ukraine-and-russia-both-need-more-soldiers">already doing</a>.</p>

Evan Spiegel, the social-media firm’s boss, said year-over-year revenue growth was 8% so far in the current quarter—“well below” forecasts made at the start of the year. Snap’s share price, which is down by nearly 80% since January, perked up on the news.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Greenhouse-gas</strong> concentrations and <strong>sea levels</strong> reached <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/06/13/carbon-dioxide-levels-in-the-atmosphere-hit-another-new-record">record highs</a> last year, according to America’s national weather forecaster. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said 2021 was among the six warmest years on record. The global average sea level rose for the tenth consecutive year and was 9.7cm higher than in 1993, when satellite measurements started.</p>

<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>European Union</strong> voted not to impose a blanket ban on visas for <strong>Russians. </strong>Some member states, such as the Czech Republic and Denmark, had been pressing for such a measure, but others opposed it—Germany and France warned it could alienate future generations of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/24/western-sanctions-will-eventually-impair-russias-economy">Russians</a>. EU ministers voted instead to suspend a visa facilitation agreement with Russia, which had made visa issuance easier.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Taiwan</strong> warned on Wednesday it would “counter-attack” Chinese forces that entered its territory and refused to leave. <strong>China</strong> has increased its military drills around <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning" data-tegid="dqrbamt89mbqei1c1gt987773680qe7c">Taiwan</a> following the recent visit of Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of America’s House of Representatives.

<h3>Europe accelerates its energy reforms</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“Preventive maintenance” of its pipelines is how Russia reminds Europeans of its energy chokehold on the continent. On Wednesday it closed down Nord Stream 1, a pipeline that delivers natural gas from Russia to Germany and beyond, supposedly for three days. That will rattle Europeans, who are trying to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter">refuel</a> ahead of winter. Gas prices soared on the news last week.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The flow through Nord Stream 1 had already thinned, following ten days of maintenance in July. Russia says sanctions made it difficult to source parts to keep it running properly; Germany denies that. Either way, expensive gas is pushing up <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/26/energy-bills-in-britain-are-soaring">energy tariffs</a> across Europe, squeezing the finances of households and governments. That has prompted the EU to mull an emergency measure to decouple gas and electricity prices, though details remain scarce. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/23/how-to-fix-the-worlds-energy-emergency-without-wrecking-the-environment">structural reform</a> of the energy market is also brewing, as European leaders seek to move past Russia’s pipeline politics.</p>
<h3>The UN faces its own deadline</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The departing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has promised to end her tenure on Wednesday with the release of a long-awaited report on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2020/10/17/the-persecution-of-the-uyghurs-is-a-crime-against-humanity">Xinjiang</a>. The western Chinese region, where the state appears to run a gulag for Uyghurs, a Muslim minority of 12m, is home to some of the world’s most glaring attacks on human rights. Yet the UN report has been three years in the works and its publication delayed for months. That is testimony to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/01/08/china-and-america-prepare-for-a-human-rights-showdown-at-the-un">China’s leverage</a> over the organisation. China issued a letter, signed by some 40 other countries, requesting the UN to bury the report. Last week Ms Bachelet revealed her office was under “tremendous pressure” over its publication.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The commissioner faces two tests. The first is whether she will meet her own publication deadline. The second is how harshly she will be willing to criticise China. Her heavily controlled <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/05/19/the-uns-human-rights-chief-is-finally-about-to-visit-xinjiang">visit to Xinjiang</a> in May dampened hope of that.</p>
<h3>Feeling the heat of the COP27 summit</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday climate and environment ministers from the G20 countries—the world’s leading economies—will meet in Bali, Indonesia. They will be focused on COP27, a UN climate summit to be held in Egypt in November. At the previous <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2021/11/11/what-happened-at-cop26">summit in Glasgow last year</a> world leaders acknowledged that their pledges to reduce carbon emissions were not nearly strong enough to meet the previously agreed goal of keeping global temperatures “well below” 2°C above pre-industrial levels. They vowed to do better. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But so far only two G20 countries have made good on that promise. Australia now plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 43% by 2030 (against 2005 levels), up from the previous figure of 26-28%. India, meanwhile, promises a cut of 45% over the same period, up from 33-35%, provided that it receives “international resources” to reach the goal. With less than ten weeks until COP27, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/11/05/what-really-goes-on-during-cop-climate-negotiations">expect a squabble</a> in Bali over who should offer what, and—as ever—who should pay. </p>
<h3>Tragedy foretold in Ethiopia’s war</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Both Ethiopia’s government and the rebels accuse the other of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/25/two-ethnic-revolts-rack-ethiopia-at-the-same-time">shooting first</a>. A fragile truce which held up for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/02/a-fragile-ceasefire-offers-hope-in-ethiopia">five months</a> in the country’s north has crumbled. Fierce fighting around the border between the Tigray and Amhara regions is spreading. Hopes for a peace deal between the federal government and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) have been dashed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Tigray has been under siege for more than a year. TPLF leaders warned they would restart the fight if Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, failed to release the hold. Abiy’s government refused talks appended by such “preconditions”. Two days after the ceasefire collapsed on August 24th, its forces struck Tigray’s capital, Mekele, killing at least four people including two children. The Tigrayans have since gathered momentum, advancing towards the Amhara town of Weldiya and threatening to seize it. That might just be a precursor to a strike westwards, to reclaim territory annexed by Amhara at the start of the war. </p>
<h3>Venice makes up for lost time</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">After two quiet years overshadowed by the pandemic, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2021/09/13/a-poignant-abortion-drama-prevails-at-the-venice-film-festival">world’s oldest film festival</a> returns on Wednesday with an abundance of high-profile films from Oscar-winning directors. The 79th gala in Venice opens with “White Noise”, an adaptation of Don DeLillo’s novel, written and directed by Noah Baumbach, responsible for “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2019/09/04/marriage-story-probes-the-painful-disintegration-of-a-relationship">Marriage Story</a>” in 2019. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The following days will feature screenings of Andrew Dominik’s “Blonde”, based on Joyce Carol Oates’s fictionalised biography of Marilyn Monroe; “Bardo”, a Mexican semi-autobiographical comedy-drama from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2015/12/04/inarritu-is-cinemas-mad-genius">Alejandro Iñárritu</a> (“<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2016/02/19/the-revenant-is-ahead-by-a-nose">The Revenant</a>”); and “Bones and All”, a cannibal road movie starring Timothée Chalamet and directed by Luca Guadagnino (“<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2017/09/08/call-me-by-your-name-is-a-work-of-beauty">Call Me By Your Name</a>”). That line-up of the festival’s favourite male directors will be supplemented by Olivia Wilde. She is making her Venice debut with a 1950s-set mystery, “Don’t Worry Darling”, featuring her <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2018/01/16/visualising-the-careers-of-musicians-turned-actors">pop-singer boyfriend</a>, Harry Styles. Cinema-starved fans and paparazzi alike will be in for a feast.</p>
