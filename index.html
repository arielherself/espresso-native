<p class="customisedFont">Big <strong>banks’</strong> fourth-quarter <strong>earnings </strong>reflected a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/17/investment-banks-are-struggling-in-a-high-interest-rate-world">slowdown in dealmaking activity</a> amidst high interest rates and fears of a coming recession. Profits at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, which recently conducted a round of lay-offs, fell by 66% from the same period a year ago, to $1.3bn. The bank’s share price slumped by 6%. <strong>Morgan Stanley’s</strong> profits fell by 40% year over year, to $2.2bn, but managed to beat expectations.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>yen</strong> tumbled against the dollar after the <strong>Bank of Japan</strong> stuck to its ultra-loose monetary policy framework. Markets had expected the central bank to overhaul its yield-curve control policy after it had widened the band for ten-year bond yields in December amid rising inflationary pressure. Yields, which had risen in recent weeks, fell in response to the announcement.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia’s</strong> defence minister said its <strong>army</strong> would <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/how-deep-does-the-rot-in-the-russian-army-go/21808989">expand</a> by 30%, to 1.5m troops, in the next three years. Karelia, on the border with Finland, will get its own army corps. Separately, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, committed to sending <strong>Ukraine </strong>a Patriot missile-defence system, as America and Germany have done, or training Ukrainian troops on how to use it.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A court in the Philippines acquitted <strong>Maria Ressa</strong>, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, of tax evasion. Many thought the charges against Ms Ressa to be politically motivated—her Rappler news site was a persistent thorn in the side of the Philippines’ previous government, led by Rodrigo Duterte. She is currently appealing against a six-year prison sentence, handed down following a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2019/02/14/yet-another-critic-of-the-president-is-arrested-in-the-philippines">dubious</a> libel conviction in 2020. </p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Disney</strong> rubbished <strong>Nelson Peltz</strong>, the activist investor seeking a spot on its board, saying he “lacks a basic understanding” of the media industry. Last week Trian Partners, Mr Peltz’s fund, said Disney was a “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/21/disney-brings-back-a-star-of-the-past-but-its-real-problem-is-the-script">company in crisis</a>” that needed shaking up. In a presentation to investors on Tuesday, Disney retorted, in capital letters, that Mr Peltz does not have “the skill and experience to assist the board”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Brazil’s</strong> president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, dismissed 40 troops who guard his official residence after criticising the country’s <strong>armed forces</strong> for failing to stop the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2023/01/12/a-copycat-insurrection-in-brazil-and-its-troubling-aftermath">recent insurrection</a>. Last week Lula described security forces as “complicit” in the storming of government buildings on January 8th. The presidential-residence guards are mainly from the army.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Pier Antonio Panzeri, a former MEP from Italy, agreed to a plea deal with Belgian prosecutors regarding the<strong> influence-peddling scheme</strong> involving Qatar that has gripped the <strong>European Parliament</strong>.

<h3>Belarusian democracy on trial</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday a show trial of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/04/02/sviatlana-tsikhanouskaya-argues-that-europe-will-be-safer-if-belarus-is-free">Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya</a> and four other democracy activists begins in Belarus. But Ms Tskihanouskaya—the leader of the country’s opposition who challenged its president of 28 years, Alexander Lukashenko, in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2020/08/13/belaruss-election-was-a-sham-the-wests-response-has-been-feeble">sham elections</a> in 2020—will not be present. She fled the country soon after the polls and has been on the run ever since. This week she is in Davos, at the World Economic Forum, to speak about economic revival in a democratic Belarus.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Concern over Belarus’s domestic repression has been largely superseded by condemnation of its support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But that repression has escalated since the election. Hundreds of civil-society groups have been closed down. Some 1,500 dissenters have been locked away. Earlier in January Ales Bialiatski, a human-rights activist and winner of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/07/the-nobel-peace-prize-recognises-human-rights-groups-that-spoke-truth-to-putinism">Nobel Peace Prize</a>, was tried in Minsk, the capital, on charges of financing protests. Ms Tsikhanouskaya’s own litany of sins supposedly includes treason and rioting. She has called her trial in absentia a “disgrace”. She will probably be found guilty.</p>
<h3>Britain’s tight labour market</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Britain’s inflation figures for December, published on Wednesday, will probably show that price pressures are easing, partly due to declining energy prices. Perhaps more important for the Bank of England’s future decisions on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/12/08/rising-interest-rates-and-inflation-have-upended-investing">interest rates</a>, however, will be the labour market figures for the three months to November, published on Tuesday. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Despite a slowing economy, there is little sign of rising unemployment in Britain. Such a tight labour market worries the bank. A specific concern is rising levels of economic inactivity: a large number of workers left the labour market during the pandemic, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/27/where-did-all-britains-50-somethings-go">mainly older ones</a>. To lure them back Britain’s Treasury reportedly even considered offering tax breaks to the over 50s to make the office look a bit more attractive than early retirement. An increase in the number of workers seeking jobs would be a far less painful way to create some labour market slack than using higher interest rates to dampen demand.</p>
<h3>Two inquiries into a South Korean tragedy close</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">South Korea’s parliamentary probe into the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/03/when-a-disaster-shakes-a-country-political-leaders-face-peril">events</a> of October 29th 2022, when 159 people were killed in a crush in Seoul, wrapped up on Tuesday. That night Halloween revellers packed into the narrow alleyways of Itaewon, a popular partying destination, until the sheer mass of bodies turned deadly. A separate police inquiry that concluded on January 13th referred 23 people for prosecution, but blamed only local functionaries, absolving the government despite a feeling that it should take responsibility. The parliamentary probe came to a different conclusion: it found Lee Sang-min, the interior minister, at fault.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">It is unlikely to bring solace to the victims’ families. The parliamentary investigation was constantly sidetracked and delayed by politicking, self-serving recriminations and testy exchanges. It ended in a similar fashion, with members of Mr Lee’s party contesting the conclusion. The families of the victims, and the public, will probably continue to push for answers.</p>
<h3>Elon Musk’s tweeting on trial</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Long before his $44bn impulse-bid for Twitter, Elon Musk was paying for his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/19/elon-musks-44bn-education-on-free-speech">intemperate use of the social-media platform</a>. One tweet in particular has cost him dearly: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420 [a share]. Funding secured,” wrote Mr Musk, falsely, in August 2018. The share price of his electric-car company, well below that level at the time, duly soared. But no such deal was remotely at hand. America’s Securities and Exchange Commission promptly sued him for fraud, which Mr Musk settled, incurring a $20m penalty. On Tuesday a separate securities-fraud lawsuit goes to trial in San Francisco. The Tesla investors bringing the case to court allege that Mr Musk’s reckless statement cost them billions of dollars. Mr Musk denies the charge.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ironically, in surveys, people say firms whose bosses use social media are much more trustworthy than those who avoid it. Mr Musk seems to be an exception. The SEC now requires that all his Tesla-related tweets be vetted by a lawyer for the firm—the so-called “Twitter sitter”.</p>
<h3>A musical pioneer reckons with mortality</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ryuichi Sakamoto, a Japanese composer, releases “12” on Tuesday, his 71st birthday. He penned the album’s dozen musical sketches as he recovered from his second battle with cancer.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The album seems a distant, stripped-down relative of the jaunty synth-pop that Mr Sakamoto produced as part of Yellow Magic Orchestra, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2019/04/18/make-brexit-bearablewith-japanese-ambient-music">pioneering electronic-music</a> outfit. (Yukihiro Takahashi, another member of the group, died last week.) Dark synthesiser drones pair with wandering piano solos. Sparse chords ring out and are left to fade unaccompanied—a seeming meditation on mortality, and on what persists and what must decay. The tracks’ titles are simply the dates they were composed, the exception being a mid-album <em>sarabande</em>, or triple-metre dance.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This intimate, unnerving sound-diary hints at the composer’s evolving moods and physical condition. His frail, laboured breathing can often be heard clearly; so, too, can birdsong. These imperfections, Mr Sakamoto says, were left intentionally on the recordings, reminders that even as breaths grow short, life dutifully carries on. </p>
