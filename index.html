<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s</strong> core consumer price index, a measure of <strong>inflation</strong> excluding food and energy costs, rose by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">just 0.2%</a> in November, its second straight month at a subdued level. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by just 0.5 percentage points, after four consecutive rises of 0.75 percentage points. Markets in Europe and America rose on the inflation news.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Federal prosecutors in New York charged <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars">former boss of FTX</a>, with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-faces-many-years-in-jail">eight crimes</a>, including wire fraud and money laundering. Those add to civil fraud charges by America’s Securities and Exchange Commission. At a congressional hearing John J. Ray III, the new boss of the crypto exchange, said his predecessor presided over “old-fashioned embezzlement”. Mr Bankman-Fried was arrested on Monday in the Bahamas.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China </strong>withdrew its state-mandated “itinerary code” app that tracked people travelling to areas with high rates of <strong>covid-19</strong>. It is the latest sign that the authorities are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/13/how-chinese-people-are-dealing-with-the-spread-of-covid-19">loosening draconian lockdown restrictions</a> after protests erupted against them two weeks ago. The app’s removal comes ahead of Chinese New Year holidays next month when millions travel across the country to be with their families.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Members of the <strong>European Parliament</strong> voted to strip <strong>Eva Kaili</strong> of her role as one of the body’s 14 vice-presidents. The Greek MEP has been engulfed in an alleged bribery scandal involving World Cup hosts Qatar. Greek authorities have frozen assets belonging to her and her family, and she has also been expelled from her political party in Greece. She, and Qatar, deny any wrongdoing. </p>

<h3>Sam Bankman-Fried charged with defrauding investors</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday Sam Bankman-Fried was to appear before Congress, to answer questions about the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried">collapse of FTX</a>, the crypto exchange he founded. Instead, on Monday evening he was arrested in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, at the request of American prosecutors. On Tuesday federal prosecutors in New York <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/13/sam-bankman-fried-is-charged-with-defrauding-investors">charged</a> him with eight crimes, including wire fraud and money laundering. Separate civil charges from America’s Securities and Exchange Commission allege that he defrauded investors. The Bahamas is expected to extradite him in short order.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Prosecutors have been probing whether Mr Bankman-Fried broke the law by loaning FTX customer funds to Alameda Research, his nominally independent trading firm. They have also been investigating whether he manipulated the market for two cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Fraud charges require prosecutors to prove that a defendant knowingly deceived investors or customers. In several interviews since resigning as boss of FTX Mr Bankman-Fried has professed ignorance about how the firm transferred funds to Alameda and blamed others for the lax controls. His media strategy may offer a preview of his eventual legal defence: that he was simply hapless and misinformed. </p>
<h3>High hopes for low inflation in America</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Over the past year each brief deceleration in<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/19/why-inflation-refuses-to-go-away"> inflation in America</a> has been followed by a strong rebound in price pressures<em>. </em>The latest figures, published on Tuesday, suggest that this dismal pattern may be at an end, much to the relief of investors and central bankers around the world. The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs, rose by just 0.2% in November, its second straight month at a subdued level. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Stockmarkets rallied on the evidence of disinflation. The weakening in prices is broad-based. The cost<em>s </em>of many consumer goods are falling as supply-chain issues melt away.<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/20/housing-markets-face-a-brutal-squeeze"> Property prices</a> are also weakening, weighed down by elevated<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done"> interest rates</a>. But pressures are not about to disappear overnight. In the ultra-tight labour market, wages are rising fast. As Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on, oil prices could easily soar again. Relief at the slowdown in inflation remains circumscribed.</p>
<h3>What African governments want from America</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/05/20/the-chinese-african-relationship-is-important-to-both-sides-but-also-unbalanced">China’s presence in Africa</a> is subject to intense scrutiny by the West. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/12/why-russia-wins-some-sympathy-in-africa-and-the-middle-east">Russian interference</a> on the continent worries Western governments, too. But America, one of the worriers, also has clout in the region. The arrival of dozens of African leaders in Washington on Tuesday, for the first US-Africa Leaders Summit since 2014, is testament to its role.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For many African countries America is an indispensable security ally. Its trade terms also offer preferential access to African exporters. And American humanitarian aid has saved millions of lives. Yet African politicians want more from their relationship with America, especially when their economies are suffering from the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and their own mismanagement. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Donald Trump saw Africa through the prism of America’s contest with China. But Joe Biden wants to show that he takes the continent’s own agenda seriously. American officials say this summit is about listening to what Africans have to say. But Africans will still want to hear what America has to offer.</p>
<h3>How to rebuild Ukraine, from Paris</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, are jointly hosting a conference in Paris on Tuesday on aid for Ukraine. Mr Zelensky is appearing by video link, while his prime minister, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/ukraines-prime-minister-says-reconstruction-planning-must-start-now/21808965">Denys Shmyhal</a>, is in the French capital to drum up support for his war-battered country. Mr Shmyhal estimates that the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/08/donors-are-already-mulling-a-marshall-plan-for-ukraine">full-scale reconstruction</a> of Ukraine will cost $750bn.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The conference has two parts. An international roundtable is considering how to help Ukraine survive the winter. Mr Macron wants pledges for the supply of generators, medical equipment and other aid. A further bilateral discussion will consider how French firms can help with reconstruction. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The meeting comes when Mr Macron is keen to show that, despite suggestions <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/14/emmanuel-macron-seeks-to-advertise-his-support-for-ukraine">from eastern European allies</a> that he is soft on Russia, France is fully behind Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute, a German research outfit, of EU countries only Germany has pledged more aid.</p>
<h3>World Cup semi-finals begin</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday Argentina and Croatia meet in the first semi-final of the football World Cup in Qatar. Argentina will look to avenge their early defeat by Croatia at the last World Cup, in 2018. But that will be easier said than done. The Croatians have a knack for winning games <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even">against the odds</a>. In their last match they shocked the pre-tournament favourites, Brazil, winning on penalties. And they have unfinished business of their own, having been runners-up last time around.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Whoever wins will face the victor of the second semi-final, between France and Morocco, on Wednesday. France, the defending champions, who beat Croatia in that final <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2018/06/09/for-all-its-faults-the-world-cup-in-russia-is-worth-celebrating">in 2018</a>, are the odds-on favourites to win their semi-final and the whole competition. But Morocco has already progressed further than any African team before, beating Belgium, Spain and Portugal. Triumph against France—the country’s former colonial overlord—would add to the long list of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/09/qatars-world-cup-has-seen-the-biggest-upsets-in-recent-history">upsets</a> in Qatar.</p>
