<p class="customisedFont"><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> warned of “Armageddon”, if Russia were to use tactical nuclear bombs in an attempt to turnaround its fortunes in Ukraine. The American president said he believed that Vladimir Putin was “not joking” when he threatened to use such weapons. Russia’s recent pounding on the battlefield has prompted rare public criticisms of senior <strong>Russian</strong> officials, including from Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-appointed deputy governor of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/05/russias-annexations-in-ukraine-are-a-legal-and-strategic-mess">annexed</a> province of Kherson. He lashed out at Russia’s “incompetent military leaders” in a video message. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>EU</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong> agreed to “jointly develop tools” to normalise the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/europes-energy-market-was-not-built-for-this-crisis">energy market</a> and reduce <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices">prices</a>. Norway is now the EU’s largest external gas supplier as the bloc reduces its reliance on Russian energy following the invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile <strong>Britain’s</strong> national grid will ask households to lower their energy use, warning of potential blackouts this winter.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Quarterly profits at <strong>Samsung Electronics</strong> fell for the first time in three years, as demand for smartphones and memory chips plummeted. The South Korean conglomerate—the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/10/21/samsung-electronics-wants-to-dominate-cutting-edge-chipmaking">market leader</a> in both fields—estimated that operating earnings in the third quarter dropped by 32%, to 10.8trn won ($7.7bn), compared with a year earlier. The woeful state of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/10/05/inflation-and-rising-demands-on-governments-are-changing-economic-policy">world’s economy</a> is mainly to blame. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>UN’s human rights council</strong> rejected a debate on <strong>China’s</strong> treatment of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/07/12/what-is-happening-to-the-uyghurs-in-xinjiang">Uyghurs</a> and other minority groups. The motion was proposed by Western countries including America, Britain and Canada. Pakistan, one of 19 countries to vote no, said it did not wish to alienate China. It is only the second time that a motion has been rejected by the council since it was established in 2006.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Mr Biden</strong> pardoned all Americans convicted of simple <strong>marijuana</strong> possession under federal law, fulfilling a campaign pledge. The move affects more than 6,500 people. He also ordered a review of whether marijuana should remain, for sentencing purposes, in the same class of drugs as heroin and LSD. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/05/14/in-california-the-worlds-largest-legal-weed-market-is-going-up-in-smoke">Recreational marijuana use</a> is legal in 19 states and Washington, DC.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> said it would redirect inbound travellers from <strong>Uganda</strong> to five designated airports for <strong>Ebola</strong> screening starting on Friday. In the past two weeks Uganda has recorded more than 60 confirmed or probable cases of the disease and 29 deaths. Its Ebola outbreak is caused by a strain of the virus for which there is no licensed vaccine—the existing vaccine targets a separate strain.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Porsche</strong> overtook its former parent company, Volkswagen, to become Europe’s most valuable carmaker a week after its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/22/porsche-goes-to-market">initial public offering</a>. Shares in Porsche rose to €93 ($91), giving it a valuation of €85bn compared with Volkswagen’s €78bn, after the banks involved in the company’s IPO bought nearly 3.8m shares.</p>

<h3>Could the Ukraine war turn nuclear?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The further Ukraine forces advance, the higher the risk that Russia will respond with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear">nuclear weapons</a>. So America’s admonitions against doing so are becoming harsher. In September senior American officials warned Russia of “catastrophic” and “horrific” consequences if it went nuclear. Some whisper that America might then have to respond militarily, probably with conventional rather than nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For months American officials said they detected no change in Russia’s nuclear posture. Now, less reassuringly, they see no change “that would cause us to alter our posture”. One recently said there was no sign of the “imminent” use of nukes. All this leaves open the possibility that America sees something stirring in Russia’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict">nuclear establishment</a>, but is not reacting to it. One analyst has spotted movement in a unit that stores and transports Russian nuclear warheads. An Italian newspaper reported that Russia may soon test a nuclear-capable torpedo. Other officials insist these are false alarms. But the jitters are growing.</p>
<h3>Chasing Arizona’s political centre</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Statewide elections in Arizona, where a third of voters claim no party affiliation, have recently been won by razor-thin margins. Yet Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent seeking re-election in November’s Senate race, comfortably leads his Republican rival. Independents seem unconvinced by Blake Masters, a venture capitalist whose racist dog-whistling during the primary secured him Donald Trump’s endorsement. So Mr Masters will try to soften his image, and broaden his appeal, when he debates Mr Kelly on Thursday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Kelly, by contrast, understands how to woo the political centre. Recognising that Democrats’ <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall">perceived weakness on border security</a> could cost him votes, he takes a tough line on immigration. He supports building out the wall along Arizona’s border with Mexico and has co-sponsored a bill to help recruit and retain more border-patrol agents. That defensive posture should serve him well: <em>The Economist</em>’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate/arizona">forecasting model</a> gives him a 92% probability of winning on November 8th.</p>
<h3>A new European talking-shop</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The leaders of 44 European countries are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/06/meet-the-brand-new-european-political-community">gathering in Prague</a> on Thursday for the first meeting of the “European Political Community” (EPC). The format, floated by Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, allows for a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/05/26/reheated-plans-for-a-multi-tiered-europe-revive-familiar-suspicions">looser continental grouping</a> of the EU’s 27 members alongside 17 outer-circle countries: aspiring members (Serbia, Ukraine), happy outsiders (Norway, Switzerland) or the recently departed (just Britain).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">That is a tricky crowd to manage. The summit will feature different discussion streams to keep apart pairs of countries best not left in the same room, such as Greece and Turkey. But the EPC has received an early endorsement from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/07/can-liz-truss-fix-britain">Liz Truss</a>, Britain’s new prime minister, who will attend despite her country’s fluctuating relationship with the continent. EU leaders will stay on after the meeting ends to discuss tightening sanctions against Russia, after EU ambassadors approved a long-awaited deal for an oil-price cap on Wednesday. A closer-knit Europe, then, both in format and in substance.</p>
<h3>Disease and political turmoil flood Pakistan</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Pakistan’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/devastating-floods-like-pakistans-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world">devastating floods</a> may be receding, but their costs are compounding. This week the UN raised its aid appeal for the country to $816m, up from $160m. The revision was prompted by fears of hunger and a surge in water-borne diseases. More than 140,000 cases of malaria were reported in its southern Sindh province in the first three weeks of September. Swathes of farmland remain submerged.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Pakistan’s government appears ill-equipped to cope. The climate minister, Sherry Rehman, has admitted that government coffers are running dry. The botched response is leaving officials red-faced. On Monday Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister, refused to start using a government dashboard monitoring flood relief, saying it was shoddily designed. The opposition, led by Imran Khan, a former prime minister, is adding to Mr Sharif’s problems. Mr Khan has called on his party’s officials to assemble millions of supporters to descend on the capital this week to rally for fresh elections.</p>
<h3>“The Woman King”: a female-led African epic</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Marvel Studios’s “Black Panther” proved that Hollywood could sell an action movie with an African setting and a predominantly black cast. “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2018/04/05/africas-past-is-inspiring-some-of-its-most-interesting-fiction-today">The Woman King</a>”, which is already out in American cinemas and released in Britain this week, goes one step further. Gina Prince-Bythewood, an American director, has made a rip-roaring historical epic, set in the prosperous west African kingdom of Dahomey (now part of Benin) in the 1800s, and populated it largely with black women.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Viola Davis, who won an Oscar for “Fences” in 2017, stars as General Nanisca, the leader of an all-female military regiment which defends Dahomey from neighbouring warlords. (The regiment actually existed; Nanisca didn’t.) Most of the key behind-the-camera roles are taken by women, too. While “The Woman King” is perhaps too forgiving of Dahomey’s part in the international <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2018/05/12/the-story-of-one-of-the-last-slaves-transported-to-america">slave trade</a>, otherwise it is inspirational: an historical epic that makes history.</p>
