<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>European Commission’s</strong> president, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined plans for a windfall tax on energy companies that will aim to raise €140bn ($140bn). The levy would be used by member states to shield consumers and businesses from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices">sky-high</a> energy prices resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mrs von der Leyen suggested the EU was “in for the long haul” in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Sweden’s</strong> Social Democratic prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, conceded defeat in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/12/swedens-election-remains-too-close-to-call">recent elections</a> and said she would resign on Thursday. According to the most recent tallies right-wing parties scored a three-seat majority. That means Ulf Kristersson of the centre-right Moderate party will lead talks between them to form a government. Once shunned by other parties, the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats won the second-largest number of votes.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>California </strong>filed an antitrust lawsuit against <strong>Amazon</strong>, claiming that the e-retailer penalises merchants for selling their wares on other sites at cheaper prices. Amazon prevents price competition through “coerced agreements”, the state alleged in its complaint, and demotes merchants who fail to abide by those rules. The state attorney-general wants such contracts banned in California, where Amazon has 25m customers.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The 83-year-old founder of <strong>Patagonia</strong>, a privately held maker of outdoor apparel based in California, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/09/14/people-trust-executives-to-intervene-in-social-issues-says-jeffrey-sonnenfeld">pledged all of its future profits</a> to fighting climate change. Yvon Chouinard said he had set up a charity to disburse Patagonia’s profits, which amount to about $100m a year. He said the arrangement was preferable to selling Patagonia and donating the proceeds, or taking the company public.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s </strong>president, promised to free all Russian-occupied territories including Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. He made the comments while visiting the city of Izyum, which was liberated during Ukraine’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run" data-tegid="snudeohht55arf6598k3ea2j6hetveh5">recent counter-offensive</a>. Meanwhile Reuters reported that Russian officials told Vladimir Putin earlier in the war that a peace deal had been struck in which Ukraine agreed not to join NATO, but that Russia’s president rejected it.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A court in <strong>St Petersburg </strong>set in motion the dissolution of a local council, after some of its members called for Mr Putin to be removed from office. One of the councillors claimed they had also been fined 47,000 roubles ($780) for “discrediting” the regime. The Russian president is under pressure at home as the war in Ukraine goes sour.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Armenia </strong>claimed that <strong>Azerbaijan </strong>had restarted strikes on its territories, just a day after Russia said it had brokered a ceasefire between the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/13/why-azerbaijan-and-armenia-are-fighting-again">Caucasian countries</a>. Both sides claim that the truce has been broken by the other. Around 100 Armenian and 50 Azerbaijani soldiers have been killed in the fighting. The clashes are the deadliest since a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2020/11/12/a-peace-deal-ends-a-bloody-war-over-nagorno-karabakh">six-week war in 2020</a>.</p>

<h3>Xi Jinping’s first post-covid trip</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Nearly 1,000 days after he <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/09/08/xi-jinping-will-at-last-venture-abroad-again">last left China</a>, President Xi Jinping arrived in Central Asia on Wednesday. A summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation in Uzbekistan on Thursday and Friday offers Mr Xi an opportunity to support a fellow delegate: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Mr Xi’s first stop, though, is Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">China has invested heavily in the country, which sends back oil and gas. It was from Kazakhstan that Mr Xi in 2013 launched the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2017/05/14/what-is-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, a global infrastructure binge. The country also borders China’s Muslim-majority Xinjiang province, where more than 1m Uyghurs have been thrown into “re-education” camps. Kazakhstan’s government has remained quiet on the matter.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In October Mr Xi is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as chief at a Communist Party congress. Travelling now looks like a sign of confidence. But he faces big challenges at home, not least over <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/09/08/public-patience-with-zero-covid-is-wearing-thin-in-china">frustration</a> with his “zero-covid” policy. For now, only diplomacy is returning to the pre-pandemic normal.</p>
<h3>The return of the Detroit motor show</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For the first time since the pandemic the latest cars are being shown off in Motor City. Many of them will be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/06/02/the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-not-happening-fast-enough">electric</a>. The North American International Auto Show, in Detroit, opened for journalists and industry insiders on Wednesday. President Joe Biden attended, to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/13/joe-bidens-industrial-policy-is-big-bold-and-fraught-with-difficulty">promote</a> the investments in electric-car manufacturing that his infrastructure and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/08/americas-climate-plus-spending-bill-is-flawed-but-essential">climate-change laws</a> aim to boost.<br/><br/> Yet not everyone in Detroit is convinced that electric cars offer all the solutions. Some worry that their simplicity threatens the region’s engineering expertise, built on the combustion engine. Firms like Tesla and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2021/11/10/rivians-giant-listing-comes-amid-huge-losses">Rivian</a> do not make cars in Detroit. A wider worry is that EVs, which tend to be weightier than those which run on petrol, may bring fresh dangers to American roads. Road deaths are rising, and heavier vehicles are deadlier in crashes. Among the heaviest is the four-tonne Hummer EV—which is manufactured in Detroit.</p>
<h3>Google’s latest day in court</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday Google’s parent company, Alphabet, largely lost its appeal against the European Commission’s decision in 2018 to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2018/07/21/google-is-fined-eu43bn-in-the-biggest-ever-antitrust-penalty">impose a record anti-trust fine</a> of €4.3bn (then $5.1bn). The European Union’s executive branch said the firm’s licensing of its Android operating system to handset-makers had illegally helped it maintain its dominant position in the smartphone market. Judges at a court of the European Court of Justice upheld many of the arguments but decided that a modestly reduced fine of €4.1bn ($4.1bn) was more appropriate.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The case was the latest in a series in which the European Commission has tried to rein in America’s tech giants. Last year Alphabet also lost an appeal against <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2017/07/01/the-european-commission-levies-a-huge-fine-on-google">an antitrust fine</a> of €2.4bn, imposed by the commission in 2017 for abusing its monopoly in online search. But the court’s decisions have swung both ways. In June the court threw out a €1bn antitrust <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2018/01/27/qualcomm-is-fined-for-anti-competitive-practices-again">fine against Qualcomm</a>, a big chip designer.</p>
<h3>The state of the European Union</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">How will Europe <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/how-to-deal-with-europes-energy-crisis">get through winter</a> without the Russian gas it has previously relied on? On Wednesday Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president, proposed to raise €140bn ($140bn) through windfall taxes on energy companies to ease the burden of rising prices on households and businesses. During her annual “state of the union” address to the European Parliament Mrs von der Leyen said that it was “wrong” for companies to make record profits as a result of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The bloc is also discussing energy price caps and mandatory limits on electricity demand. Mrs von der Leyen called energy markets <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/europes-energy-market-was-not-built-for-this-crisis">unfit for purpose</a> as they allowed the high price of gas to drive up electricity costs. Energy ministers from the EU’s 27 member states will thrash out the details at a meeting on September 30th. The priority will be for Europe to present a united front, even as it faces recession.</p>
<h3>The great crypto merge</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In the early hours of Thursday morning a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/06/the-future-of-crypto-is-at-stake-in-ethereums-switch">major change</a> in the architecture of crypto will take place. Ethereum, the most important blockchain platform, will change the way it is run. Ethereum currently uses an energy-intensive mechanism called “proof-of-work” to verify transactions. But at around 4am GMT (equivalent to UCT, the benchmark time standard used by developers) it will “merge” with a new chain that uses “proof-of-stake”, a verification method that uses much less energy.<br/><br/> The environmental advantage is the most obvious reason for even those who take no interest in crypto to care about “the Merge”. But it is not the only one. The event is the first in a series of upgrades that should make Ethereum more efficient and scalable—and potentially more useful. That is assuming all goes smoothly, of course. Implementing the switch is like swapping the engine of a spaceship mid-flight. Time to find out if it can be done.</p>
