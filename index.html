<p class="customisedFont">In a joint statement the leaders of America, Canada and Mexico condemned violent riots in <strong>Brazil</strong> by supporters of <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong>, a former president. Meanwhile, some of Joe Biden’s fellow Democrats asked him to expel <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/12/31/brazils-new-president-faces-a-fiscal-crunch-and-a-fickle-congress">Mr Bolsonaro</a> from their country—he is currently in hospital in Florida, with abdominal pain. Police in Brazil have arrested around 1,500 people involved in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2023/01/09/supporters-of-jair-bolsonaro-mount-an-insurrection-in-brazil">the storming of government buildings</a> in the capital, Brasília, on January 8th.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia’s budget deficit</strong> widened to a record 3.3trn rubles ($47bn) for 2022, according to its finance ministry. The country has offset the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/24/western-sanctions-will-eventually-impair-russias-economy">costs of its invasion</a> of Ukraine with gas and oil revenues, maintaining a budget surplus for most of the year. But European restrictions on Russian energy imports and the G7’s oil-price cap pushed its budget to new depths in December.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>EU </strong>and <strong>NATO</strong> signed a joint declaration—the first since 2018—to tighten cooperation against “security threats and challenges” presented by Russia and China. The agreement is a formal recognition of the stronger ties forged between the two organisations since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But it was long postponed by fears that the EU’s foray into defence policy would undermine <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/26/nato-holds-its-most-important-summit-for-decades">NATO’s role</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russian</strong> forces are probably in control in most of <strong>Soledar</strong>, a town near <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut">Bakhmut</a> in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, according to Britain’s defence ministry. Russia and mercenaries from the Wagner Group may now turn their attention to capturing Bakhmut. Earlier Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said Soledar’s walls were knocked flat and its ground littered with (Russian) corpses as Ukraine repelled the attack. </p>

<p class="customisedFont">America’s <strong>greenhouse-gas emissions</strong> increased by 1.3% in 2022, according to estimates from Rhodium Group, a research firm. That puts emissions back on their long-term trajectory of slowly declining growth after the pandemic, which caused an abrupt drop in 2020 and then a sharp uptick of 6% in 2021. The relative amount of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/08/economic-growth-no-longer-means-higher-carbon-emissions">emissions produced by economic activity</a> also appears to be decreasing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> stopped issuing short-term visas for visitors from <strong>Japan</strong> and <strong>South Korea</strong> in retaliation for the two countries imposing <strong>covid-19</strong> restrictions on Chinese travellers. China’s embassy in Seoul said it would adjust its policy if South Korea lifted “discriminatory entry restrictions”. Meanwhile <strong>Pfizer</strong> said it would begin manufacturing <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/28/paxlovid-appears-to-be-reaching-the-americans-who-need-it-least">Paxlovid</a>, an antiviral drug that fights covid, in China within three to four months.</p>

A repurposed jumbo jet operated by <strong>Virgin Orbit</strong>, a space-launch firm, sent up a rocket over the Atlantic. After ignition, however, the rocket failed to deploy any of the nine satellites it was carrying. Meanwhile <strong>Galactic Energy</strong>, a Chinese rocket startup, fared better: it put five satellites into orbit on Monday.</p>

<h3>Another attempt to reform French pensions</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">French leaders tinker with pension rules at their peril. One attempt to get the French to work until later in life, in 1995, was shelved after weeks of protests and strikes. So was Emmanuel Macron’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2019/12/12/french-workers-strike-to-keep-their-lavish-pensions">first effort</a> as president, which he abandoned in 2020. On Tuesday his government will try again. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">It is expected to recommend raising the retirement age from 62 years to at least 64. French workers retire earlier than those in most other OECD countries, and live longer too. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/02/25/money-matters-take-centre-stage-in-frances-election">cost</a> of paying current French pensions is 14% of GDP, nearly double the OECD average. By 2032 the system will face a gaping deficit.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet the government’s plan will prompt protests. Mr Macron <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/19/emmanuel-macron-loses-his-parliamentary-majority">lost his parliamentary majority</a> last year and public opinion, unions and most opposition parties are against increasing the retirement age. This latest pension battle will be a litmus test for the president’s hopes of continuing to reform France in his second term.</p>
<h3>TikTok goes to Brussels</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">​​Shou Zi Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, a China-based social-media platform, will meet representatives of the EU in Brussels on Tuesday. The meetings, including one with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/05/28/why-margrethe-vestager-ticks-all-the-boxes">Margrethe Vestager</a>, the EU’s antitrust chief, are unlikely to yield headline-grabbing results. But they are a sign that the EU is keeping a close eye on the firm. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Brussels insiders say they will not hesitate to make TikTok comply with the EU’s digital laws, such as the new Digital Services Act, which aims to limit illegal content on online platforms. Politicians and parents worry that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/briefing/2022/07/09/the-all-conquering-quaver">TikTok</a>, which serves users an addictive stream of videos, does not moderate its content well enough. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Regulators are also concerned about privacy, particularly transfers of personal data to China. TikTok is already subject to several EU investigations. Still, the bloc is unlikely to ban the service, or force it to sell itself to a Western firm, as is being considered in America. There, the “tech cold war”with China is already in full swing.</p>
<h3>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond buckles</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Investors received more bad news on Tuesday when Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, an American homewares giant with around 700 shops, reported a quarterly loss of about $393m. Last week the company warned that sales have fallen considerably. Wary suppliers have reduced deliveries to BB&amp;B outlets, emptying its shelves, after the company fell behind on payments.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The news follows a painful few years. An underinvestment in e-commerce saw BB&amp;B’s sales start to slump in 2018. An attempted turnaround was derailed by an unsuccessful shift toward own-brand products at the expense of those from recognised firms. Hopes were lifted last year when Ryan Cohen, an activist investor beloved by amateur traders, took a stake in the business and the chief executive was shown the door. But they were dashed again when Mr Cohen sold out in August. Although BB&amp;B raised fresh funds last year and shuttered around 150 shops, its mounting losses and shrinking cash reserves have inspired rumours of a pending bankruptcy.</p>
<h3>Turkey’s largest Kurdish party under threat</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday Turkey’s high court began hearing the government’s case for shutting down the country’s largest Kurdish party—five months ahead of general and presidential elections in June. The government says the People’s Democratic Party (HDP) has violated anti-terror laws. The court will also hear cases against 451 individual HDP members, including nearly all its parliamentarians. Any found guilty will be banned from politics for five years. Last week a different court froze the party’s funds.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2015 the HDP became the first Kurdish party to take seats in parliament. Today it is the third-largest party overall, holding 56 of 600 seats. But Turkey’s government, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, accuses the HDP of links to the banned <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/06/28/what-is-the-pkk">Kurdistan Workers’ Party</a> (PKK), an armed group fighting an insurgency in southeast Turkey. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Kurds account for around one-fifth of Turkey’s population. Their votes are important in any opposition bid to topple Mr Erdogan. But if the HDP is outlawed then the main opposition bloc, which includes nationalists hostile to the Kurds, will struggle to woo their vote.</p>
<h3>The Golden Globes glitter again</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Golden Globes ceremony on Tuesday will be a star-studded affair. Broadcast live on NBC the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s 80th awards bash will include Quentin Tarantino, Ana de Armas and Jamie Lee Curtis among its presenters, and Steven Spielberg, Daniel Craig and Elizabeth Debicki among its nominees.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">What a difference a year makes. Last year’s ceremony took place in private, with no celebrity guests. The HFPA was in disgrace after the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2021/03/01/covid-19-and-controversy-at-the-golden-globes"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> spotlighted its lack of black members and love of freebies. A few reforms later, including the appointment of a chief diversity officer, and Hollywood seems to have forgiven and forgotten. With box-office takings last year one-third lower than before the pandemic, perhaps the industry will accept all the publicity it can get. Or maybe after Will Smith, an actor, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/12/14/how-to-understand-2022-in-memes">slapped</a> Chris Rock, a comedian, at last year’s Oscars, the Globes seem quite respectable in comparison.</p>
