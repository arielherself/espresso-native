<p class="customisedFont">The<strong> Federal Reserve</strong> raised its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point. That follows four consecutive three-quarter-point increases and brings the federal-funds rate to a range between 4.25% and 4.5%, its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/14/to-fix-americas-inflation-problem-the-federal-reserve-must-go-big">highest since 2007</a>.

<h3>The Fed downshifts to a slower rate rise</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Wednesday marked the start of a new phase in the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation. After four consecutive <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done">interest-rate increases</a> of 0.75 percentage points, America’s central bank opted for half a point at its December meeting. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In part that reflects the Fed’s confidence that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/07/inflation-is-falling-but-not-enough">inflation is easing</a>. Data released on Tuesday showed the core consumer-price index rose by just 0.2% in November. But there are two crucial caveats. First, it takes a long time for rate changes to filter through the economy. The combined impact of the past year’s tightening will only show up next year. The risk of a recession will grow even as rate increases get smaller.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Second, the Fed has been at pains to insist that it will keep rates elevated for as long as is needed to bring inflation to heel. A slowdown in rate increases does not equate to an easing of monetary policy.</p>
<h3>A crackdown in Bangladesh</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday Bangladesh will mark the anniversary of the murder, by a militia controlled by the Pakistani army, of intellectuals just before the end of the war of independence in 1971. The shadow of that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2017/03/28/virtual-revenge-is-sweet-in-bangladesh">conflict</a> looms large in Bangladesh. The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, whose party, the Awami League, led the independence struggle, faces demands from the opposition for her resignation. She in turn accuses the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party of favouring Pakistan. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The real issues, claims the BNP, are the poor state of the economy and Sheikh Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies. In recent weeks the party has been holding massive protests, capitalising on public anger about slowing economic growth and surging inflation. It regards the conviction and jailing on corruption charges of its leader, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2018/02/08/the-conviction-of-khaleda-zia-hobbles-bangladeshs-opposition">​​Khaleda Zia</a>, a former prime minister, as political persecution. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The government has cracked down hard on the protests. Several thousand BNP activists have been arrested, many on charges of inciting violence. Elections are not due until January 2024. There is no sign that tensions will ease before then.</p>
<h3>Better news for Germany’s economy</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday the Ifo Institute, a think-tank in Munich, published its quarterly economic forecast for Germany. It was less gloomy than the last one, published in September. The institute suggested that an impending recession will be less severe than it had previously expected. The Ifo now forecasts that the German economy will contract by 0.1% in 2023, compared with earlier forecast of a 0.3% decline. In a separate survey conducted in November, Ifo found that business confidence has been buoyed as Germany filled all of its storage facilities for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/01/meet-the-man-who-may-decide-the-fate-of-german-industry">natural gas</a>, even though no Russian gas has arrived since September, easing panic about soaring energy costs. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The rate of inflation may have already peaked which should mean that, after a steep fall, households’ real incomes can rise again. Germany’s politicians will hope that increased consumer spending will provide the motor of recovery in the second half of next year. But they cannot be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/13/europe-is-growing-complacent-about-its-energy-crisis">complacent</a>. Energy shortages, and high prices, could return <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/29/europes-next-energy-crunch">next winter</a>. </p>
<h3>Travel operators hope for a happier 2023</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As Europe shivers through a cold snap, travel operators will hope that winter-weary consumers book big plans for next summer. After three years of pandemic restrictions and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/07/travel-chaos-in-europe-is-a-glimpse-of-a-future-with-few-spare-workers">labour shortages</a>, the industry is trying to return to normal. An early sign of progress came on Wednesday, when TUI, a German travel operator, reported its latest results. The firm announced its first quarterly profit since the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/take-that-covid-revenge-tourism-takes-off">start of the pandemic</a>, with guest numbers back to 93% of pre-pandemic levels over the summer.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">TUI says it is “optimistic” about the year ahead, noting that early bookings for next summer are up on last year. But <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/31/europe-is-heading-for-recession-how-bad-will-it-be">high inflation</a> and rising interest rates mean less spending money, and could yet stem the flow of bookings. And a group of more than 500 British holidaymakers are suing the company after an outbreak of gastric illness spoiled their summer get-aways this year. Uncertainty still clouds the skies.</p>
<h3>One step closer to controlled fusion power</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, announced on Tuesday that the country’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) had lived up to the “I” in its name, by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/12/13/controlled-fusion-power-is-little-nearer-now-than-it-was-a-week-ago">achieving ignition</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The stuff ignited was some pellets of a frozen mixture of deuterium and tritium—isotopes of hydrogen. “Ignition” means that NIF, which creates fusion in such pellets by bombarding them simultaneously with 192 laser beams, had started a reaction which released more energy than was put into the pellet by the beams. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Granholm made a great fuss about that. But the huge amount of energy required to generate the beams in the first place (which did not form part of the headline calculation) means this approach is not even close to yielding a route to civil fusion power. Since NIF’s main job is military (the understanding of hydrogen bombs) that does not directly matter. But if civil fusion does come about, it is unlikely to be done in this way.</p>
