<p class="customisedFont">President Joe Biden said it was “unlikely” that two <strong>Russian-made missiles</strong> that landed in <strong>Poland</strong> were fired from within Russia itself. Leaders of the G7 held an emergency meeting after two people were killed by munitions on Polish territory, near the border with Ukraine. An actual Russian attack—on a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/poland-will-play-an-outsized-role-in-western-efforts-to-assist-ukraine/21808064">NATO</a> country—would mark an alarming escalation. But Ukraine also uses Russian-made missiles, notably in air-defence systems. Neither Poland nor America offered a further explanation for what happened.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/16/of-course-donald-trump-is-running-again">announced</a> that he would run for the American presidency again, in <strong>2024</strong>. In a speech at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, Mr Trump said that the country had been “brought to its knees” by Joe Biden. He focused less on the lie that the election of 2020 had been stolen from him, but added a twist: China interfered on Mr Biden’s behalf, he said. After many of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/09/the-rise-of-ron-desanctimonious">candidates he favoured</a> in last week’s midterm elections foundered, some senior Republicans dared to counsel Mr Trump against running again.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> won the Republican party’s nomination for speaker of <strong>America’s House of Representatives</strong>, beating Andy Biggs, another Trump devotee, by 188 to 31. The Republicans look likely to wrest control of the House, albeit with a slim majority and deep internal schisms. Still, a hardline block of right-wing Republicans may yet dash <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/kevin-mccarthys-accidental-truthfulness/21808964">Mr McCarthy’s</a> hopes of becoming speaker in a House-wide contest in January.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Russian <strong>long-range missiles</strong> struck targets across Ukraine including <strong>Kyiv</strong>, the capital, damaging more crucial <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/01/keeping-ukraine-from-freezing-this-winter">energy infrastructure</a>. At least half of the city is without electricity, according to the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. Elsewhere, the Russian army withdrew further from the eastern side of the Dnieper river, opposite the city of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/14/kherson-celebrates-liberation-and-a-visit-from-volodymyr-zelensky">Kherson</a>, the southern provincial capital it abandoned last week.</p>

The company’s stock rose by more than 7%. The firm also agreed to pay $3.1bn to American states and cities which sued the retailer for contributing to the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2020/10/31/american-lawmen-are-going-after-opioids-inc">opioid crisis</a> by failing to regulate prescriptions.

<h3>Vladimir Putin’s ghost at the G20</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Russia’s president stayed away from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit">the G20 summit</a>, yet haunts the gathering in Bali. His <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/imagining-peace-in-ukraine">war in Ukraine</a> has aggravated the many problems, from inflation to the food crisis, the group is grappling with. It also makes reaching agreements harder.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There will probably be no family photo because many Western leaders refuse to be pictured next to Mr Putin’s stand-in, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister. As with other recent G20 events, there may be no final communiqué, since Russia objects to Western efforts to have leaders denounce the invasion and its repercussions. A draft text declaring that “most member countries strongly condemned” the war, while acknowledging differences in “national positions”, is under negotiation. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Many countries feel they are paying for a conflict that does not concern them. “If the war does not end, it will be difficult for the world to move forward,” said the summit’s host, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia. Mr Putin’s reply: the largest-yet volley of missiles aimed at crippling <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/24/ukraine-races-to-stop-russia-from-destroying-its-power-grid">Ukraine’s power grid</a>.</p>
<h3>America’s Respect for Marriage Act</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When America’s Supreme Court<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/24/the-supreme-court-erases-the-constitutional-right-to-abortion"> overhauled the right to abortion</a>, it also raised the spectre of curtailing <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/05/30/what-the-abolition-of-americas-right-to-abortion-could-mean-for-other-rights">other liberties</a>. In agreeing with the decision, a conservative justice, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/who-is-clarence-thomas">Clarence Thomas</a>, wrote that the court “should reconsider” rulings protecting same-sex marriage and access to contraception, too. On Wednesday Congress is expected to pass a law codifying same-sex and interracial marriage—both of which are legal because of Supreme Court rulings rather than federal legislation.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Respect for Marriage Act has been kicking around for a decade, but was revived in July. It would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by a Republican-controlled Congress in 1996, which allowed states to ban gay marriage, but was later defanged by two Supreme Court decisions.<br/><br/> Few Senate Republicans publicly support the bill. But Democrats say they have enough votes to ensure it will pass—and it received 47 votes from House Republicans in July. With more than 70% of Americans telling pollsters they support gay marriage, protecting it is popular.</p>
<h3>China changes direction</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Declining economic growth has finally crossed a pain threshold for China’s leaders. For over two and a half years policymakers have been cracking down on the spread of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/financial-markets-bet-on-an-end-to-chinas-zero-covid-policy">covid-19</a> and runaway <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/how-a-housing-downturn-could-wreck-chinas-growth-model/21805115">property-sector</a> debt, with dire effects. Now they have announced some big changes.<br/><br/> Quarantine times for inbound travellers and close contacts of those testing positive for covid have been reduced. And bank loans to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/14/a-radical-shift-in-chinas-property-and-pandemic-policies">property developers</a> due to be repaid within the next six months can now be extended. The plans, in theory, will get people spending more money and developers building more homes. But big questions remain. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Loosened covid restrictions could lead to widespread outbreaks. In cities such as Guangzhou cases are already rising rapidly. It is unclear yet how authorities will deal with this. Easing in the property sector will stop defaults but this does not guarantee people will buy new homes in droves. A boost to economic growth could be a way off.</p>
<h3>NASA takes off, at last</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Just before 2am on Wednesday at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, NASA launched its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/08/24/nasas-space-launch-system-is-yesterdays-rocket">Space Launch System</a> rocket. The uncrewed SLS was originally scheduled to fly in 2016. The rocket that actually left the pad was assembled in 2021, but its launch was delayed repeatedly, twice because of problems with its engines.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">More recently the rocket was left out during Hurricane Nicole on November 10th, though NASA’s engineers reckon no significant damage was done. But even its successful launch is unlikely to quiet its critics. Built using recycled parts of the Space Shuttle, and as much a job-creation programme as anything else, the SLS has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/28/nasas-newest-rocket-is-a-colossal-waste-of-money">cost $23bn</a> to develop. Estimates for a single launch touch $2bn (at least). It has competition, too. SpaceX, a private firm, is building a similar rocket called Starship, and is aiming for launch costs of just 1% of that. In theory, as part of NASA’s Artemis programme, the SLS will return American astronauts to the Moon in 2025. Almost no one thinks that deadline will be met.</p>
<h3>Maradona’s “hand of God” ball at auction</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The football that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2020/12/03/diego-maradona-died-on-november-25th">Diego Maradona</a> punched into the goal, in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final match between Argentina and England, goes on sale in London on Wednesday. Maradona later said the “hand of God” had intervened. A few minutes later the Argentine scored what became known as the “goal of the century”—arguably the greatest solo run in the history of the sport. It cemented Maradona’s reputation as a sporting deity.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The sale will make Ali Bin Nasser, the Tunisian who refereed the match (but did not see the handball), a rich man. The estimate for the now rather deflated ball at auction is around £3m ($3.5m). The number 10 jersey Maradona wore that day, and swapped after the game with England’s midfielder, Steve Hodge, sold for £7.1m in May. The World Cup, which kicks off in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/10/the-world-cup-is-tarnished-should-fans-enjoy-it-anyway">Qatar</a> on Sunday, could fuel interest from bidders. Unlike his eyesight, Mr Nasser’s timing may be immaculate.</p>
