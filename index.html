<p class="customisedFont">Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s new chancellor of the exchequer, said taxes would have to rise and public spending would be cut. Mr Hunt was appointed on Friday to reassure investors after Liz Truss, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/14/liz-truss-has-lost-her-chancellor-signature-tax-cut-and-authority">hapless prime minister</a>, had sacked his predecessor <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/14/kwasi-kwartengs-tenure-as-britains-chancellor-wasnt-the-shortest">Kwasi Kwarteng</a>. It remains to be seen whether Mr Hunt’s intervention—which amounts to a repudiation of his boss’s political programme—will calm the jittery gilt markets. On Friday Ms Truss abandoned plans to scrap a corporation-tax rise. But yields rose over concerns she had not gone far enough. Conservative MPs are now deciding whether to defenestrate yet another prime minister—one who was only appointed in September.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Vladimir Putin </strong>said a drive to mobilise troops for his war in Ukraine would probably end within two weeks. Russia’s president said around 220,000 people have been drafted—fewer than the number who have <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/30/europeans-should-welcome-russian-draft-dodgers">fled the country</a> to dodge the draft. Meanwhile the <strong>Pentagon </strong>approved a further $725m in military aid for Ukraine. Among other things, the new package will replenish ammunition supplies for the HIMARS rocket systems that have helped Ukrainian forces <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/13/ukraines-new-rockets-are-wreaking-havoc-on-russias-army">wreak havoc</a> on Russian troops.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">An <strong>explosion</strong> at a coal mine in northern <strong>Turkey</strong> killed at least 28 people. Rescuers have so far evacuated 11 miners, but dozens remain trapped underground. Turkey’s energy minister, Fatih Donmez, said the blast may have been triggered by firedamp, a flammable gas found in some coal mines. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced plans to visit the site.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong> warned that his satellite-internet company, <strong>Starlink</strong>, could not “indefinitely” fund the service in <strong>Ukraine</strong>. The Pentagon hinted that it was considering stepping in to help. Most of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/10/06/elon-musks-foray-into-geopolitics-has-ukraine-worried">20,000 Starlink terminals</a> in the country have been paid for by Western governments; Mr Musk has contributed by waiving monthly fees. But the capricious billionaire’s relations with Ukraine have soured after suggestions he has cosied up to the Kremlin.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The UN warned that around half of <strong>Haiti’s </strong>population of 9.9m are at risk of <strong>acute hunger</strong>. Almost 20,000 people face famine. Many live in slums controlled by violent criminals. The crisis in Haiti has reached boiling point in the past month; last week the government asked the UN for armed help to tackle the gangs.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A jury in New York convicted the founder and former boss of <strong>Nikola</strong>, an American <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2020/09/17/can-nikola-become-the-next-tesla">electric-vehicle start-up</a>, of <strong>defrauding investors</strong>. Prosecutors alleged that Trevor Milton made false statements about Nikola’s technology by claiming, for example, that an inoperable prototype was fully functional. Mr Milton, they said, took advantage of the fact that Nikola went public through a special-purpose acquisition company. Traditional IPOs have stricter disclosure rules.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong> is investigating whether to re-unite the two arms of his media empire. Fox Corp, which houses most of the 91-year-old magnate’s broadcast channels, and News Corp, home to newspapers including the <em>Times</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, were spun into separate companies a decade or so ago. The <em>WSJ</em> reports that committees have been formed in both boardrooms to discuss a recoupling.</p>

<h3>Russia on the back foot in Ukraine</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukrainian cities are still reeling from the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/10/russia-launches-a-wave-of-missiles-across-ukraine">barrage of Russian missiles</a> that destroyed civilian infrastructure across the country at the start of the week. But for the soldiers on the ground, there is no rest. Russian mercenaries from the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/who-is-yevgeny-prigozhin-the-man-behind-the-wagner-group">Wagner group</a> have continued their slow, grinding advance on the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk province, in Ukraine’s east. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Russia is on the back foot everywhere else. In Luhansk province, also in eastern Ukraine, Russian troops are digging in, anticipating a Ukrainian attack towards Svatove, part of Russia’s new defensive line. Russia’s position is even shakier in the south. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/10/06/ukraine-has-made-stunning-gains-on-the-battlefield">Ukraine continues to advance</a> towards a reported 20,000 Russian soldiers on the west bank of the Dnieper river near Kherson city. Their position looks extremely fragile. Vladimir Saldo, the head of Russia’s puppet regime in Kherson, has asked for Russia’s help in evacuating residents from the area. “We know that Russia doesn’t abandon its own,” he said earlier this week, plaintively.</p>
<h3>China’s largest trade expo opens—online</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The twice-yearly Canton Fair, China’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2018/11/03/china-hopes-a-big-new-expo-will-fix-its-reputation-for-protectionism">largest trade show</a>, began in the 1950s. It was held during China’s Great Famine and its Cultural Revolution. (Mao badges were then a hot commodity.) Even when the SARS epidemic struck in 2003, the show went on. But since the arrival of covid-19, the fair has moved online. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Over 34,000 Chinese firms are expected to show off their wares virtually in the 132nd edition, which begins on Saturday. Many suppliers will host live-stream video demonstrations of their products. Buyers may miss the “touch and feel” that were an important part of deal-making in the past. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">As the world economy slows, China’s trade is also <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/21/a-global-manufacturing-slowdown-suggests-worse-is-to-come">entering a difficult period</a>. The growth of exports, which provided crucial support to China’s economy last year, has slowed sharply in recent months. Visitors to the Canton Fair will not be able to touch the products. But they will <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/20/chinas-rulers-seem-resigned-to-a-slowing-economy">smell the apprehension</a>.</p>
<h3>Parisians rally against rising prices</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The French are on edge. Days of strikes at oil refineries, by workers demanding pay increases, have led to petrol shortages and long queues. Unions have called a general strike for October 18th. On Sunday demonstrators will take to the streets of Paris to protest against the rising cost of living. The march is organised by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/05/14/a-new-alliance-boosts-the-left-ahead-of-frances-parliamentary-elections">Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s left-wing alliance</a>, NUPES. Some unionists have promised to join in. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/06/annie-ernaux-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-literature-for-2022">Annie Ernaux</a>, a French novelist and winner of this year’s Nobel prize for literature, is also backing the demonstrators. Never shy of a provocative allusion, Mr Mélenchon has called on participants to “do better” than the women’s march in 1789, an early event in the French Revolution.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The planned show of force comes at an awkward time for President Emmanuel Macron. He is spending heavily to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices">tamp down energy bills</a>. But he is also planning to raise the retirement age, an unpopular measure, after having lost his parliamentary majority. France looks set for a difficult autumn, on and off the streets.</p>
<h3>The T20 World Cup</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The West Indies are the only team to win cricket’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/13/india-ought-to-win-crickets-twenty20-world-cup-but-probably-wont">Twenty20 World Cup</a> twice, triumphing in 2012 in Sri Lanka and again four years later in India. That second win was particularly memorable. Needing a daunting 19 runs from their final six balls, Carlos Brathwaite hit England’s Ben Stokes into the stands for four consecutive sixes. But if the Windies are to prevail in this year’s tournament, which begins in Australia on Sunday, they will have to do it the hard way. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Their dismal showing in the previous World Cup in 2021, where they lost four of their five matches, consigned them to qualifying for this edition. To reach the main stage, they will have to finish in the top two of a group also containing Ireland, Scotland and Zimbabwe. They will be favourites, but their task has been made more difficult by the absence of star batsman Shimron Hetmyer, who was dropped from the squad after missing his flight to Australia.</p>
<h3>Weekend Profile: Mohammed Rostami Gachi, Iran’s brutal enforcer</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It was his rapid promotion that surprised many. Just a few months into his post as the police chief of Talesh, an Iranian provincial backwater, Mohammed Rostami Gachi was promoted to head the Islamic Republic’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/26/who-are-irans-hated-morality-police">morality police</a> 400km away in the capital, Tehran. Previous Iranian governments had never thought much of him. But the incoming administration of Ibraham Raisi in 2021 admired Mr Gachi’s hardline beliefs. Shortly after taking the job he declared his intention to enforce the mandatory veil for women, which had fallen loose under the pragmatist presidency of Hassan Rouhani. “Those who stubbornly remove the <em>hijab </em>are criminals,” Mr Gachi told Iran’s press.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Over the following months, he reactivated the morality police. Their men in dark green uniforms and women in black <em>chadors</em> scoured the streets hunting for infringements of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/09/08/what-is-sharia-law">sharia</a>. They broke up bands jamming in cafes. They hauled girls caught for “bad” <em>hijabs</em> away in their windowless vans and took them to facilities for “re-education”. Sometimes they <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/09/28/im-the-same-as-mahsa-and-i-want-my-freedom-anger-at-irans-regime-spills-onto-the-streets">gave them a beating</a>. And then, on September 13th, Mr Gachi’s men carted away 22-year-old Mahsa Amini to her <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/22/why-iranian-women-are-burning-their-hijabs">death</a> three days later for improperly wearing the veil.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/10/12/are-they-watching-our-homes-are-they-in-our-phones-a-diary-of-fear-in-tehran">popular </a>protests that this sparked had, in truth, been <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/12/despite-lethal-repression-irans-protests-continue">some time in the making</a>. Under Mr Rouhani, Iran breathed more easily with an unwritten contract: leave the clerics to wield power and let society live as it wants. The Islamic republic shrank into an Islamic government. Mr Raisi’s determination to turn the clock back and apply sharia to an ever-more secular population tipped resentment into civil disobedience. Even before Ms Amini was killed, female students were spilling out of their segregated campus canteens into male ones. Women on buses and the metro disregarded even their token nod to a head covering. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The mullahs’ crackdown might have been easier to digest had they practised the moral strictures they preached. But while people’s incomes declined, mullahs’ sons ostentatiously combed Tehran’s highways in their Ferraris. And some questioned Mr Gachi’s standards of enforcement when it came to his own. His brother accumulated businesses in their hometown of Kermanshah. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">As protests against Ms Amini’s death spread—costing, so far, more than 200 lives—Mr Gachi’s patrols disappeared from the streets. Western governments have imposed sanctions against him and his morality police for “spreading a culture of violence and excessive force”. For Mr Gachi, they were just spreading Islam.</p>
