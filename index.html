<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Raphael Warnock </strong>clinched an outright majority for the Democrats in <strong>America’s Senate </strong>by defeating his challenger, Herschel Walker, in a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/12/06/whats-at-stake-in-georgias-run-off-election">run-off election</a> for his seat in Georgia. With a 51-49 majority, the Democrats can control committees and will not depend on the vice-president’s tie-breaking vote. Mr Warnock, an eloquent pastor, had been favoured by a slight margin to beat Mr Walker, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/14/who-is-herschel-walker">gaffe-prone ex-footballer</a>. Still their race, the country’s most expensive this year, was fought intensely; 1.89m people voted early, breaking single-day voting records. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">A jury in Manhattan convicted <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> real-estate company of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in">tax fraud</a>. The Trump Organisation was found guilty of paying employees off the books to dodge taxes, and could face fines of $1.6m. Separately, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/08/americas-probe-into-the-capitol-riot-is-needed-before-its-too-late">House committee</a> investigating the <strong>January 6th </strong>attack on America’s Capitol plans to make “some” criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, according to the committee’s chairman. He said the targets and substance of the referrals, which do not carry legal weight, are not yet finalised.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China </strong>is reportedly set to announce several measures to ease nationwide <strong>covid-19 restrictions</strong>. They could include reducing mass testing and allowing some infected people to be quarantined at home, Bloomberg reported. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/01/xi-jinpings-zero-covid-policy-has-turned-a-health-crisis-into-a-political-one">costs of maintaining zero-covid controls</a> are piling up.

But she is unlikely to land in jail anytime soon: her job gives her immunity and she will surely appeal against the verdict. Ms Fernández was found guilty of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/08/25/argentinas-vice-president-could-face-12-years-in-prison">abusing her authority</a> while president from 2007 to 2015 to steer inflated public-works contracts to a friend.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Hungary</strong> vetoed an EU aid package worth €18bn ($18.8bn) for <strong>Ukraine</strong>. In response member states delayed a decision about whether to disburse €5.8bn in pandemic-recovery funds to Hungary. Fuelling the stand-off are EU demands that Hungary <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/24/the-eu-is-withholding-aid-to-press-hungary-to-reform">strengthen the rule of law</a> before it gets any more money. EU finance ministers may meet again later this month in hopes of resolving the disagreement.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Latvia</strong> withdrew the broadcasting licence of TV Rain, an exiled <strong>Russian</strong> news channel that had been reporting from its capital, Riga. Latvia’s media regulator accused the channel of threatening the country’s national security and social order. TV Rain has also attracted criticism from Latvian politicians for sticking its nose into local politics. But those grumbles are misplaced: countries should welcome <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/24/russian-offshore-journalists-need-help-not-hindrance">offshore media outlets</a> that pump real news back into Russia.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Football World Cup:</strong> underdogs <strong>Morocco</strong> beat <strong>Spain </strong>to become the first Arab team ever to reach the tournament’s quarter-finals, sparking wild celebrations back home and in several parts of Europe home to a large Moroccan diaspora. They now face Portugal, who romped past Switzerland 6-1, seemingly buoyed by the absence of their ageing talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, who was dropped. The quarter-finals start on Friday.</p>

<h3>Georgia closes America’s Senate race</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">After election day in early November, most American voters can relax. Not in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/13/georgias-races-suggest-good-candidates-can-beat-partisan-reflexes">Georgia</a>, which requires a separate run-off election if no candidate secures an outright majority. In January 2021 the entire country watched Georgia’s unusual contest when its run-off decided control of the Senate.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday Georgia’s race will again conclude the national Senate battle. But this time there is less pressure: Democrats are safe in their control of the upper chamber of Congress. But they will be glad to have an extra seat. In Georgia Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent, who led the first round by one percentage point, faces <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/14/who-is-herschel-walker">Herschel Walker</a>, the gaffe-prone Republican nominee. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Other Republicans running in Georgia, such as Brian Kemp, the incumbent governor, sailed to an easy victory in November. But Mr Walker, a former football star who has not managed to outrun his personal scandals, may fall flat now that Republicans have no hope of retaking the Senate. Polls show Mr Warnock enjoying a slight lead.</p>
<h3>The EU’s tug-of-war with Hungary</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The EU has struggled for a decade to respond to Viktor Orban’s increasingly autocratic, corrupt and scofflaw government in Hungary. It now has the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/24/the-eu-is-withholding-aid-to-press-hungary-to-reform">leverage</a> to do something about it. Last week the European Commission recommended that €13.3bn ($14bn) of aid to Hungary go forward only if the country carries out reforms. Approving the proposal is now up to national governments. At a meeting on Tuesday, the EU’s finance ministers had been expected to let €5.8bn in grants from the bloc’s covid-recovery move forward, conditional on Hungary implementing 27 anti-corruption reforms. Applying conditions to €7.5bn from the EU budget was considered a closer call.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Instead, the ministers put off both discussions. Meanwhile, Hungary is playing hardball: it vetoed an €18bn aid package for Ukraine to pile pressure on its partners. EU governments now have until December 19th to make a call on Hungary’s funds. Despite years of tough talk, they may end up letting Hungary get away with embezzling European money.</p>
<h3>India’s controversial citizenship law faces a test</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Three years ago India’s parliament passed the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2020/01/23/narendra-modis-sectarianism-is-eroding-indias-secular-democracy">Citizenship Amendment Act</a>, which made it easier for migrants of certain religions coming from neighbouring countries to become Indian citizens. The glaring omission of Muslims from that list triggered deadly protests that went on for months. The demonstrations were forced to a halt by the pandemic lockdown, but they succeeded in stopping the governing Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party from implementing the law.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Now the contentious legislation looms large again. Earlier this year Amit Shah, the home minister, insisted that “CAA is and will be a reality”. India’s Supreme Court could yet foil those plans. After months of delay, on Tuesday it begins hearing more than 200 petitions challenging the law, many of which argue that the CAA violates the country’s secular constitution. India’s Muslims, who worry that the law could pave the way to threatening their own citizenship, won’t expect the court to take their side. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/17/indias-new-chief-justice-faces-a-trial-of-strength">Judges</a> have recently bent to the will of India’s heavy-handed government.</p>
<h3>Can America go green fast enough?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday the Biden administration will hold the first lease auction for offshore wind development on America’s west coast. The five sites up for grabs along the Californian coastline could propel America closer to Joe Biden’s target of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. Because the sites are in deep waters, they will also be home to America’s first floating turbines.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Investors continue to face headwinds. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/08/12/how-big-a-deal-is-the-inflation-reduction-act">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, the most ambitious climate legislation America has ever passed, includes tax breaks for clean-energy technologies. But an onerous, often litigious, permitting process means government agencies can take five years to approve a solar farm. Wind projects and transmission lines often take longer. Democrats and Republicans agree the planning process is lousy, but lawmakers spurned a reform bill championed by Joe Manchin, a senator for West Virginia. If Congress does not get its act together, America’s green dreams may be no more than that.</p>
<h3>The show struggles to go on</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In New York, show business is serious business. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2016/06/16/breaking-down-broadway">Broadway</a>’s 41 theatres contributed an estimated $15bn to the city’s economy during the 2018-19 season. The industry employed almost 97,000 people, from actors and producers to front-of-house staff, costume-makers and specialist dry-cleaners. In March 2020 the city shut its theatres as part of its coronavirus lockdown measures. Thousands of people were cut off from their source of income.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">“Broadway Rising”, a documentary released in America this week, explores what happened next. Some staff were among the earliest covid cases; performers started teaching their craft online. Many left the industry entirely. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Broadway has not bounced back yet: this summer performances of “Moulin Rouge!” had to be cancelled after a covid outbreak among the cast and crew. Audiences have been slow to return, too. The documentary considers who will suffer if the show does not, in fact, go on.</p>
