<p class="customisedFont">Russian missiles struck the centre of <strong>Kyiv</strong> during rush hour on Monday morning—the first rocket attacks on the Ukrainian capital in months. Explosions were also reported in the cities of Dnipro, Lviv and Ternopil. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said “there are dead and wounded”. The bombardment is probably retaliation for the attack that crippled the Kerch bridge, which links the Crimean peninsula to Russia, on Saturday. President Vladimir Putin declared that incident an “act of terrorism” by <strong>Ukraine</strong>, which has not claimed responsibility for it. The bridge is a crucial supply line for Russia’s invading forces in southern Ukraine, as well as being <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/08/ukraine-braces-for-retaliation-after-an-attack-on-the-bridge-from-crimea-to-russia">symbolic for Mr Putin personally</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea’s</strong> state news agency said that the country’s <strong>testing of 12 ballistic missiles</strong> over the past week, including one which flew over Japan, was intended to simulate a nuclear attack to “wipe out” targets in South Korea. The launches were a response to recent <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/18/america-and-south-korea-restart-their-big-military-drills">American and South Korean naval drills</a> around the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Malaysia’s prime minister</strong>, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, called for an early election in an effort to bolster the mandate of his fractious ruling coalition. An election was due in September 2023 but now must be held within 60 days of parliament being dissolved on Monday. That the election could coincide with the monsoon season, dampening turnout, sparked protests from the opposition.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Nobel committee awarded the <strong>Sveriges Riksbank prize</strong> in economic sciences to three economists for research into the role of banks in the economy, and how their collapse can exacerbate financial crises. The winners were <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/08/11/ben-bernanke-and-edward-chancellor-square-off-on-monetary-policy">Ben Bernanke</a>, a former head of America’s Federal Reserve who is now at the Brookings Institution, Douglas Diamond, of the University of Chicago, and Philip Dybvig, of Washington University.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Social Democrats—the party of Germany’s chancellor—came first in<strong> regional elections</strong> in the north-western state of <strong>Lower Saxony</strong>. It won a third of the votes, according to early results. But the liberal Free Democrats, the SPD’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2021/11/27/olaf-scholzs-coalition-prepares-to-take-office-in-germany">federal coalition partner</a>, failed to reach the 5% threshold needed to enter the state parliament. The hard-right Alternative for Germany took nearly 11%, double its previous share. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Alexander Van der Bellen, <strong>Austria’s</strong> president, won a second term, defeating the populist opposition by a wider margin than in 2016. With most of the votes counted, Mr Van der Bellen had 55.4% of ballots, while Walter Rosenkranz of the Freedom Party, a far-right group, had 18.4%.</p>

<h3>Making Russia a pariah</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday morning Russian missiles rained down on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, for the first time in months. The strikes, which also hit other Ukrainian cities, are retaliation for an explosion which destroyed the bridge that links the Crimean peninsula with Russia. Later on Monday the diplomatic battle will move to the UN General Assembly. Delegates will debate a Western resolution condemning <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/05/russias-annexations-in-ukraine-are-a-legal-and-strategic-mess">Russia’s annexation</a> of four Ukrainian provinces and demanding its full withdrawal. Russia vetoed a similar move in the Security Council last month. It cannot do so in the General Assembly, but the body’s resolutions are not binding. Instead the vote—which may take place on Wednesday—is intended to isolate the Kremlin.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Russia wants a secret vote. But the West is nervous, too. It secured a 141-5 vote against Russia in March but many countries, at least before Russia’s renewed attacks on civilians, were growing weary of the war. Most attention will be on the fence-sitters, among them the likes of Brazil, China, Gabon and India, which abstained in the Security Council. Getting fewer than 100 yes votes—the number that condemned Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014—would be another blow to Ukraine.</p>
<h3>Will J.D. Vance advance?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday Ohio hosts its first debate between two candidates for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate">the Senate</a>, the Republican J.D. Vance and his Democratic opponent, Tim Ryan. The Buckeye State is a fairly safe Republican stronghold. But Mr Vance, a venture capitalist who came to prominence after writing “Hillbilly Elegy”, a best-selling book about the culture of Appalachians, has struggled. He and Mr Ryan are in a dead heat; the Democratic candidate has raised enormous sums from small donors.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Vance’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/fear-of-illegal-immigrants-helps-jd-vance-triumph-in-ohios-primaries/21809098">campaign</a> has sounded almost apocalyptic at times, focusing on the threats supposedly posed to Ohio from illegal-immigrant drug pushers and their Democrat enablers. Donald Trump has stumped with him, as has Mr Trump’s son, Don Junior. Many Republican candidates across the country are chasing the former president’s supporters. The reaction to Monday’s debate will indicate whether the double Trump endorsement can push Mr Vance over the line.</p>
<h3>Overflowing in-trays at the IMF and the World Bank</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Policymakers from around the world gather in Washington on Monday for a week of annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, amid sharply deteriorating conditions for the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/06/a-new-macroeconomic-era-is-emerging-what-will-it-look-like">global economy</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Russia’s war in Ukraine has dashed the cautious optimism expressed last year. The energy crisis and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/10/05/policymakers-are-likely-to-jettison-their-2-inflation-targets">soaring inflation</a> will occupy participants. New IMF forecasts are likely to project that economies accounting for at least one-third of global output will soon be in recession. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, has warned that geopolitical and financial-sector risks mean that conditions are more likely to worsen than improve. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Officials will look for opportunities to co-operate on inflation-fighting and debt relief, in hopes of reducing the pain felt by the most vulnerable. Given the harsh reality of war, there is only so much they can do.</p>
<h3>Taiwan’s National Day</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In a speech on Monday to celebrate Taiwan’s National Day, Tsai Ing-wen, the country’s president, insisted that there is “no room for compromise” over the self-governing island’s sovereignty and democratic way of life. China’s government should respect that as a precondition to working together for cross-straits peace, she said.<br/><br/> Tensions in the Taiwan Strait are high. In August Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, visited the island and called her country’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/09/01/now-china-has-changed-its-policy-towards-taiwan-america-should-too-senator-chris-murphy">support for Taiwan</a> “ironclad”. China responded with military exercises to show its ability to blockade the island, which China regards as part of its territory.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Tsai’s government welcomes delegations from friendly countries. It has also increased defence spending and is mulling extensions to conscription. But opinion polls indicate low confidence in Taiwan’s ability to fend off a Chinese invasion. In her speech the president recognised the need for better civil defence. National Day is a chance to bolster public resolve.</p>
<h3>A new pipeline to help Germany this winter</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As winter approaches, all eyes in Europe are on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/29/europes-next-energy-crunch">the continent’s</a> gas supplies and whether anything can be done to ease dependence on Russia. Storage facilities are almost full. But Germany lacks enough import capacity to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/04/why-fracking-cannot-solve-europes-energy-crisis">meet demand</a> through shipped liquified natural gas. On Monday a retrofitted pipeline from France will open, providing relief of around 4000 GWh per month—around 3% of Germany’s demand in a typical winter month. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Whether that’s enough depends on the weather and on Germans’ willingness to put on an extra jumper. The country’s gas network regulator has called once more on households to cut back in order to avoid gas rationing. Germany’s eastern and southern neighbours, including Ukraine, will depend on supplies from the West, too. A new floating terminal in the Netherlands has started receiving deliveries to fill pipelines going east. But gas will remain scarce in central and eastern Europe. Hope for a mild and rainy Christmas.</p>
