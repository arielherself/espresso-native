<p class="customisedFont">Ministers from the<strong> G7</strong> group of big economies backed a proposal to cap the price of <strong>Russian oil</strong>. Under the plan firms would be barred from financing or insuring shipments of Russian oil if the sale price exceeds the cap. America suggested the idea out of concern that a total insurance ban, which Britain and the European Union <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/24/western-sanctions-will-eventually-impair-russias-economy">intend to impose</a> by the end of the year, would send prices rocketing. The cap for Russian crude shipments will take effect on December 5th, though the level has not yet been set.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In a seemingly tit-for-tat move, <strong>Gazprom</strong>, a Russian energy firm, said it would keep the <strong>Nord Stream 1</strong> gas pipeline shut beyond a three-day closure that was due to end on Saturday. It blamed a leak at a turbine and gave no indication when it would restart<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter"> deliveries</a>. The pipeline to Germany was only running at a fifth of capacity before it was taken offline, supposedly for maintenance, on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Pilots at <strong>Lufthansa</strong>, a German airline, went on <strong>strike</strong> on Friday, forcing the firm to cancel about 800 flights. Around 130,000 passengers are affected, some of whom are stranded in Frankfurt and Munich. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/06/09/air-travel-is-taking-flight-again">Airlines</a> have scrapped thousands of departures this summer as companies face staff shortages and strikes just as demand has picked up after long lockdowns.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">At least 18 people were killed in an <strong>explosion</strong> at a mosque in Herat, a city in western <strong>Afghanistan</strong>. The victims included Mujib Rahman Ansari, a prominent pro-Taliban scholar. No one has yet claimed responsibility, though the local affiliate of Islamic State has carried out several similar attacks in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">American employers added 315,000 jobs to <strong>non-farm payrolls</strong> in August, well below July’s figure, in a sign that hiring has started to slow. The unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percentage points from July, to 3.7%. Month-over-month wage growth eased to 0.3% in August, from 0.5% in July. That will come as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/27/the-fed-is-no-longer-taking-baby-steps-to-rein-in-inflation">welcome relief</a> to the Federal Reserve.</p>

Forty-eight of the boxes it retrieved from America’s former president were marked as containing classified information when in fact they were empty—raising the question of whether some documents remain missing. The disclosures came in a court filing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A judge in <strong>Myanmar </strong>was reported to have convicted <strong>Aung San Suu Kyi</strong> of electoral fraud and sentenced her to three years’ hard labour.

<h3>Hiring in America</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s labour market is “clearly out of balance”, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/30/central-bankers-worry-that-a-new-era-of-high-inflation-is-beginning">groused Jerome Powell</a>, chair of the Federal Reserve, last week. Demand for workers has outstripped supply, pushing up private-sector wages by more than 5% year on year. Yet while the Fed’s interest-rate rises have tightened financial conditions elsewhere—share and property prices are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/03/an-anatomy-of-this-years-market-mayhem">down</a>, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/20/why-the-dollar-is-so-strong">dollar is stronger</a>—the jobs market has remained red-hot. To policymakers’ relief, data released on Friday showed that hiring slowed in August. Employers added 315,000 jobs last month, compared with 526,000 in July. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, from 3.5% in July.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Labour-market conditions are likely to determine whether the Fed increases rates by half or three-quarters of a percentage point in September. Its task is a balancing act: raise rates high and fast enough to temper jobs and wage growth, without triggering mass lay-offs and tipping the economy into recession. A loosening jobs market suggests a softer landing.</p>
<h3>Iraq’s violent political deadlock</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Include me in your government, or face an intra-Shia civil war. That seems to be the message of Muqtada al-Sadr, an influential cleric, whose supporters have been <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/31/iraqs-political-deadlock-turns-violent">clashing this week with</a> rival Shia factions in the administrative district of Baghdad, the capital, and beyond. At stake is who heads the government. For now parties allied with Iran and their many militias dominate parliament and hold a veto over the formation of a new administration. The judiciary appears to have their back, too. That is blocking the ambitions of Mr Sadr’s nationalist movement, which emerged as the biggest bloc from last year’s election but which has withdrawn its MPs.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Although Baghdad has calmed, fighting continues in Basra, Iraq’s second city and gateway for the country’s oil supply. And Mr Sadr could yet mobilise his forces should he be excluded from the process of forming a government. Millions of angry and dispossessed Iraqis would heed his call to rise up against Baghdad’s oil-rich elite.</p>
<h3>Gadgets galore, and you can even touch them</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Internationale Funkausstellung, otherwise known as the IFA, opens its doors in Berlin on Friday. Europe’s biggest annual technology show is being held in person for the first time since the start of the pandemic. It is mainly a platform for manufacturers to show off the latest in consumer electronics. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Thus, with the football World Cup looming in November, ever-higher resolution televisions will be much in evidence. LG is due to unveil the largest ever OLED TV screen, at a whopping 97 inches. Other gadgets are likely to include a “smart” toilet developed by Samsung, which neutralises human waste, as well as shoe cases that do the same for the odour of smelly feet. There will be new smartphones too, but not the 14th iteration of the iPhone. Apple shuns such trade shows. It will launch the device at its own event, on September 7th in Silicon Valley.</p>
<h3>Germany’s trade figures fail to lift the gloom</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In May Germany recorded only a small trade surplus of €900m ($899m). Exports recovered in June, thanks to increased demand from America and China, and Germany notched up a (seasonally adjusted) surplus of €6.2bn. But that fell to €5.4bn in July, according to figures published on Friday by Destatis, Germany’s statistics agency. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The decline, however modest, will only add to the gloomy mood amongst exporters. Sky-high energy prices, supply-chain bottlenecks and the rising cost of raw materials are all worries. The Ifo Institute, a German think-tank, produces an index of exporter expectations; it fell for the third consecutive month in August.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For some companies the cost of production has become so burdensome that they are forced to reject or cancel orders, according to a recent survey by FTI-Andersch, a consultancy. Firms are reluctant to pass on increased costs to customers. And with energy prices and other production costs still high, the winter months are likely to be tougher still. </p>
<h3>Lord of the Dollars</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Streaming companies deploy several strategies to drum up interest. One is to throw lots of money at new projects. Another is to talk about how much money is being thrown. Enter “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power”, a television series released on Amazon Prime in most countries on Friday. Reportedly the most expensive series ever made, the first season alone has a rumoured price tag of $465m. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Despite Amazon’s seemingly bottomless coffers, the tech company’s streaming service has repeatedly disappointed. “The Lord of the Rings” is pure spectacle, featuring an ensemble of elves, humans and hobbits exploring sweeping vistas. But the show also risks losing itself in its expensive theatrics. For the series to achieve Amazon’s dream of winning a “giant, global audience”, it will have to make viewers care about the characters. After all, the idea behind the success of the original is simple: the power of ordinary people to confront evil. </p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme.
