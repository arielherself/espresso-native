<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Brazil’s presidential election</strong> will go to a run-off after <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/29/are-brazils-pollsters-right-about-the-presidential-election">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a>, a leftist former president, won the first round on Sunday but failed to secure the majority he needed for an outright victory. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/09/08/jair-bolsonaro-is-poised-to-lose-the-brazilian-election">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, the populist right-wing incumbent, outperformed <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/29/are-brazils-pollsters-right-about-the-presidential-election">pollsters’ expectations</a>, taking 43% of the vote to Lula’s 48%. The next round will take place on October 30th.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>OPEC+</strong> cartel of oil-producing nations is planning to announce huge cuts in production in order to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets">push up oil prices</a>, according to several reports. The group will reportedly agree to pump 1m fewer barrels a day when it meets on Wednesday. The price of Brent crude, a benchmark, has fallen markedly in recent months, from over $120 per barrel in June to under $90 today.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, confirmed that his country’s troops had taken full control of <strong>Lyman</strong>, a key logistics hub in Donetsk. Ukrainian officials say its recapture will allow the army to advance further into the Luhansk region. Meanwhile, in an address in St Peter’s square, Pope Francis called on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts">Vladimir Putin</a> to end the “spiral of violence and death” that might ultimately lead to nuclear escalation. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The death toll from <strong>Hurricane Ian</strong> continues to rise. Nearly 80 people have died in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida">Florida</a>, while four deaths have been reported in North Carolina. Thousands of Americans remain without power. Rescue operations in some coastal communities are ongoing. President Joe Biden will visit Puerto Rico and Florida this week to survey the damage there.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Protests in <strong>Iran</strong> continued across the country on Sunday. Security forces clashed with students at a university in Tehran, the capital. The demonstrations were prompted a fortnight ago by the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/29/irans-tired-regime-is-living-on-borrowed-time">murder of a young woman</a> arrested for not covering all her hair. They have since spiralled into the biggest threat to the ayatollahs’ dictatorial rule for many years.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There was mounting criticism of <strong>Indonesia’s</strong> police, as authorities said that at least 125 people were killed and 320 injured in a stampede after a football match. Supporters of Arema FC, a club from Malang, East Java, rushed onto the pitch after their team lost to regional rivals Persebaya Surabaya. Local police retaliated with tear gas which triggered mass panic.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Tesla</strong> delivered almost 344,000 vehicles globally in the third quarter, a record for the American electric-car maker. The total came in under the 358,000 deliveries that analysts had expected, according to Bloomberg. Tesla said in a statement that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/06/12/how-supply-chain-turmoil-is-remaking-the-car-industry">logistical challenges</a> were to blame. </p>

<h3>Will Brazil get rid of Bolsonaro?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Reports of Jair Bolsonaro’s downfall were, it seems, exaggerated. In the run-up to the first round of Brazil’s contentious <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/09/08/jair-bolsonaro-is-poised-to-lose-the-brazilian-election">presidential election</a>, polls suggested that Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president, could beat the right-wing populist incumbent by anywhere from six to 17 percentage points. But a few hours after voting closed on Sunday, and with almost all the ballots counted, it emerged that—while Lula had beaten Mr Bolsonaro with 48% of the vote to 43%—he had not secured enough of a majority to win outright.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The election will now go to a second round on October 30th. The result is far from certain. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/29/are-brazils-pollsters-right-about-the-presidential-election">Pollsters</a> appear to have quite dramatically underestimated the amount of support for Mr Bolsonaro, possibly because polls tend to overrepresent poorer Brazillians, who favour Lula. Plus, many fear that Mr Bolsonaro will <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/win-or-lose-jair-bolsonaro-poses-a-threat-to-brazilian-democracy">reject the result</a> if he loses anyway. Like his hero Donald Trump, he has already whipped up concern that voting machines (which Brazil has used nationwide for two decades) lead to fraud. </p>
<h3>One nation, one fertiliser in India</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">No government in India wishes to upset <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/11/19/why-has-narendra-modi-abandoned-cherished-plans-to-overhaul-indian-farming">farmers</a>, a votebank of more than 100m. So when the war in Ukraine sent fertiliser prices soaring, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was quick to act. Within two months it announced new subsidies worth $8bn, on top of bulky existing ones. As a result, the expected cost of subsidising fertilisers this fiscal year will reach 2.5trn rupees ($31bn), around 1% of the country’s GDP.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Naturally, the government also wants to get credit for this largesse. From Sunday all bags of fertiliser sold in the country must be emblazoned with government insignia. Private fertiliser firms complain this will hurt their brands, but the government insists that uniformity will streamline distribution. The opposition has called the move a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/05/19/indias-politicians-have-figured-out-how-to-turn-welfare-into-votes">marketing</a> gimmick by Narendra Modi, the prime minister, and the BJP. There is a clue in the project’s official name: <em>Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Urvarak Pariyojna</em>, meaning Prime Minister’s all-India fertiliser scheme, which shortens handily to “PMBJP”.</p>
<h3>The hidden meaning of horror</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Blumhouse Productions, a film and television company, is responsible for some of the most popular horror movies of the past couple of decades. “Paranormal Activity”, a film presented as if it was made up of found video recordings, was released in 2007 and earned almost $200m from a paltry production budget of $15,000. “The Purge” franchise has made more than $450m at the box office. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The company has now lent its name to “Blumhouse’s Compendium of Horror”, a documentary series which airs on Sunday in America. The show makes a simple—and somewhat repetitive—argument: that the horror genre, far from purveying cheap, gory thrills, has always <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/01/04/film-makers-are-finding-horror-not-comfort-in-the-natural-world">held a mirror up to society</a>. “Dracula”, the talking heads say, encapsulated feelings about the wealthy during the Great Depression. “Godzilla” drew on Japanese viewers’ grim memories of atomic bombs. Blumhouse, it seems, considers itself part of a venerable tradition of collective catharsis. </p>
<h3>Leopoldstadt comes to New York</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Often hailed as Britain’s greatest living playwright, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2015/01/15/tom-stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a> has long used his erudite, linguistically dazzling plays to probe philosophical ideas. But his latest work, “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2020/02/13/tom-stoppards-haunting-new-play-about-the-holocaust">Leopoldstadt</a>”, gets more personal. Set in Vienna between 1899 and 1955, it traces the fate of a large and very well-off Jewish family that had assumed that success and assimilation made them more Viennese than Jewish. As the decades pass, they learn that their finery and oil portraits won’t keep them out of Auschwitz. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">At 85, Sir Tom seems to be finally reckoning with his own inheritance, having lost his four Jewish grandparents and much of his Czech family to the horrors of the Holocaust. With this play, he elegantly conveys the guilt that comes with survival, and the duty to remember what was lost. The show, now at the Longacre Theatre on Broadway after an acclaimed run in London, also reminds the audience that this all happened not so long ago.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin’s private-army supremo</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">This week <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/who-is-yevgeny-prigozhin-the-man-behind-the-wagner-group">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a> stepped out of the shadows. The close ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, admitted for the first time that he founded the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation">Wagner Group</a>, a network of guns-for-hire that does much of Russia’s dirty work. “I cleaned the old weapons myself, sorted out the bulletproof vests myself,” said Mr Prigozhin of Wagner’s early days.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The mercenaries emerged in Ukraine in 2014 to aid Russia’s annexation of Crimea and back up pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The group then expanded wherever Russia had an interest, including <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2017/11/02/how-wagner-came-to-syria">Syria</a>, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2019/12/12/foreign-powers-are-piling-into-libya">Libya</a>, the Central African Republic and Mali.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">As for Mr Prigozhin, little is known about his childhood. He spent most of his 20s in prison, serving nine years for robbery and fraud. After his release, he set up a hot-dog stand in St Petersburg in the 1990s. He soon opened chic eateries: his New Island floating restaurant was a favourite of Mr Putin, at the time deputy mayor of St Petersburg. His associations with Russia’s elite brought lucrative catering gigs for schools, hospitals and the army—and earned him the nickname “Putin’s Chef”. But it was his work outside the kitchen that earned him a reputation in the West. In 2018 American prosecutors indicted Mr Prigozhin, alleging that he financed a Russian “troll farm” to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2018/02/17/putins-chef-cooks-up-a-storm">spread online misinformation</a> during the presidential election in 2016.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Prigozhin long denied involvement in Wagner’s bloody operation, and sued journalists who suggested as much. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine the group may have helped capture several eastern cities. Mr Prigozhin is putting his name to that. He may think that Russia’s tattered relationship with the West means there is no more point in maintaining the open secret. He may also be reminding Mr Putin, amid <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces">battlefield losses</a> and a backlash against mobilisation at home, of his loyalty and value.</p>
