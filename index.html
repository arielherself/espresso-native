<p class="customisedFont">At least 153 people died in a <strong>crush</strong> during Halloween celebrations in Seoul, the capital of <strong>South Korea</strong>. Another 82 were injured and the city has reportedly received thousands of missing-person reports. The president, Yoon Suk-yeol, promised to thoroughly investigate the cause of the tragedy, which took place in the Itaewon district, a popular area for nightlife.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The EU encouraged <strong>Russia </strong>to reverse course after it withdrew from a deal allowing <strong>grain exports</strong> from Ukrainian ports. Russia claimed that Ukrainian drones had attacked ships from its Black Sea Fleet taking part in the initiative. On Friday António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, had urged that the agreement, which was reached in July and is due to expire next month, be extended.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> passed a new “Women’s Rights and Interests Protection Law”, aimed at combating gender <strong>discrimination </strong>and <strong>harrassment</strong>. It is the first such change to the law in 30 years, although the exact details of the new measures have not yet emerged. However, the legislation comes at a time of concerns over the continuing marginalisation of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/27/chinas-problem-with-female-representation-is-getting-worse">women in politics</a> and other spheres of life.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong> has reportedly ordered <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">staff cuts</a> at <strong>Twitter</strong>. The layoffs are expected to happen before employees’ stock options vest on Tuesday, according to the <em>New York Times</em>. The sackings could mean Mr Musk avoids paying that compensation. It is unclear how many employees will get the axe, though previous reports suggested he could cull 75% of the social-media firm’s 7,500 staff.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Two <strong>car-bombs</strong> killed at least 100 people in Mogadishu, <strong>Somalia’s</strong> capital, said Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/07/19/somalias-president-wants-help-to-fight-africas-terrorist-groups">president</a>. The attack came as Mr Mohamud, his prime minister and other officials met to discuss combating violent extremists—in particular, those of al-Shabab, a jihadist group affiliated with al-Qaeda. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts. An al-Shabab truck-bomb at the same place in 2017 killed more than 500 people.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Britain’s opposition Labour Party demanded an investigation into reports that <strong>Liz Truss’s </strong>phone was <strong>hacked</strong> by suspected Russian agents while she was foreign secretary. The <em>Mail on Sunday</em> reported that a year’s worth of messages—some pertaining to the war in Ukraine—was stolen and that the cyber-theft was discovered during the summer’s Conservative party leadership contest, which (<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/20/who-will-be-britains-next-leader">briefly</a>) made her prime minister.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong> ordered <strong>Rwanda’s</strong> ambassador to leave within 48 hours.

On Saturday M23 seized the town of Kiwanja in the province of North Kivu, about 70km from Goma, the main city in the east.</p>

<h3>How a fake egg saves baby sea turtles</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Every summer, Florida’s beaches host a miraculous event: clutches of baby sea turtles emerge from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2020/10/08/a-new-device-may-help-stop-the-robbery-of-turtles-nests">their nests</a> in unison. But predators and obstacles left by humans prevent most of the hatchlings from reaching the surf. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/technology-quarterly/2021/06/15/loss-of-biodiversity-poses-as-great-a-risk-to-humanity-as-climate-change">Conservationists can protect them</a>, but only if they know the hatching date. Until now, that has been guesswork. No one can keep watch all the time. But now researchers have devised a gadget that predicts the right moment, according to a paper published in <em>PLoS ONE</em>, a journal.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">TurtleSense is a movement sensor encased in a mock turtle egg. Over five nesting seasons researchers buried these changelings in real nests. The sensor picks up the vibrations made by turtles hatching; when movement suddenly ceases it is a signal that the newborns are about to head to the sea. (Normally they emerge together exactly two nights later.) This early warning system allows conservationists to rescue more turtles—while keeping beaches open for holiday-makers.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Li Qiang, China’s probable next prime minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It is now all but certain who China’s next prime minister will be. On October 23rd, when Xi Jinping walked onto a podium in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People with members of his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/27/xi-jinping-has-surrounded-himself-with-loyalists">reshuffled leadership team</a>, the man directly behind him was Li Qiang, the Communist Party chief of Shanghai. That meant the 63-year-old Mr Li, whose promotion prospects many analysts had written off just a few months ago, had become China’s highest-ranking politician after Mr Xi. He is expected to take over from Li Keqiang (no relation), the 67-year-old current prime minister, when the legislature meets next March.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The younger Mr Li is a remarkable choice. Earlier this year he was widely blamed by Shanghai residents for the chaotic and harsh management of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/04/09/a-clumsy-lockdown-of-shanghai-is-testing-the-zero-covid-strategy">weeks-long lockdown</a> of the city, aimed at crushing an outbreak of covid-19. Even without the lockdown fiasco, he would have been an unlikely candidate for prime minister. The post is normally given to people who have served as a deputy PM. Li Qiang has never held a central-government portfolio.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But it is clear why Mr Xi likes him. In the 2000s, when Mr Xi was the party boss of the coastal province of Zhejiang, Li Qiang was his chief of staff. Enforcing strict lockdown measures in Shanghai may have further endeared him to China’s leader, who has just secured a norm-breaking third term as the party’s general secretary and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. (Mr Xi has been a keen advocate of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/13/china-shows-few-signs-of-loosening-its-zero-covid-policy">“zero-covid” approach</a> to crushing the virus.) </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Li is liked by many businessmen, but foreign investors were spooked by the reshuffle and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/25/xi-jinping-provokes-a-spectacular-sell-off-in-chinas-markets">dumped Chinese shares</a>. They worried that Mr Xi had surrounded himself with yes-men who would do little to curb his dirigiste instincts. In truth, Mr Xi’s power has long been subject to little restraint from colleagues. The promotion of Mr Li and other loyalists may not do much more to embolden him.</p>
<h3>America’s apathetic young voters</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Sunday Bernie Sanders, the octogenarian left-wing senator from Vermont, will rally young and working-class voters in Texas just over a week out from midterm elections on November 8th. Although Democrats’ <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/15/a-grassroots-group-is-channelling-public-frustration-in-texas">bid to unseat Greg Abbott</a>, Texas’s Republican governor, is unlikely to succeed, some House seats are up for grabs. Turning out young voters may be key to winning them. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Sanders faces an uphill battle. Young-voter <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/24/how-much-do-americas-voting-access-reforms-affect-turnout">turnout</a> in Texas was 41% in the 2020 presidential election. But turnout is much lower in midterm elections, in particular among young voters. A third of respondents aged 18-29 told pollsters from <em>The Economist</em>/YouGov that they are paying no attention to the midterms; fewer than half say they will definitely vote. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Nearly a quarter said voting was simply too inconvenient. And yet some local officials seem intent on making it more so. This year officials in Brazos County, home to Texas A&amp;M (the largest university in America, with a student body of 72,000), closed the only early-voting site on campus. </p>

<h3>The curtain closes on a controversial golf series</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A divisive season ends on Sunday with the final event in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/06/17/will-signing-stars-like-phil-mickelson-bring-success-to-liv-golf">LIV Golf series</a> at the Trump National Doral course in Miami. Soaked with Saudi money, the new competition has offered elite golfers a lighter and more lucrative schedule than the established PGA Tour. But splitting the field has diluted the competition on both circuits. It has also caused huge disharmony among the top players. Some, such as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, refused to take LIV loot; others, notably Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson, decided that the moolah was too much to turn down. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Over the winter, lawsuits brought by both sides are expected to progress. Three LIV-contracted players are suing the PGA Tour, accusing it of acting monopolistically, while the PGA Tour is accusing LIV of interfering with its player contracts. No one expects a truce by the time LIV returns for its second season, most likely in February, with an even bigger purse.</p>

<h3>Brazil’s toxic presidential run-off</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Brazilians will decide their country’s fate on Sunday in the most consequential <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/27/brazils-election-is-tight-ahead-of-a-run-off-on-october-30th">presidential run-off</a> of recent times. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/27/brazils-election-is-tight-ahead-of-a-run-off-on-october-30th">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, the populist far-right incumbent, has claimed (without providing evidence) that the elections might be rigged. He received 43% of votes in the first round on October 2nd, while Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/19/how-left-wing-on-economics-is-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva">former president</a>, came out on top with 48%. But the gap is closing. <em>The Economist</em>’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/brazil-2022">poll tracker</a> shows Lula on 52% and Mr Bolsonaro on 48%. Given the margin of error, that is technically a tie.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The campaign has been vicious. The candidates have accused each other of communism, satanism, cannibalism and paedophilia. There have been 1,700 complaints about employers coercing employees to vote their way. A politician allied with Mr Bolsonaro threw grenades and fired a rifle at police attempting to arrest him this week. More turmoil may be coming. Taking a page from Donald Trump’s playbook, Mr Bolsonaro has suggested he may <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/09/08/jair-bolsonaro-is-poised-to-lose-the-brazilian-election">not accept defeat</a>.</p>
