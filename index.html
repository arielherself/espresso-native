<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong> agreed to send armoured combat vehicles to <strong>Ukraine</strong>, after long resisting such aid for fear that Russia would view it as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/giving-ukraine-heavy-weapons-does-not-mean-nato-is-at-war-with-russia/21808835">escalatory</a>. America will supply Bradley vehicles; Germany will send Marders and also donate a Patriot missile-defence system. Separately, <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> ordered a unilateral ceasefire between noon on Friday and midnight Saturday to mark Orthodox Christmas. An advisor to Ukraine’s president dismissed the gesture as “hypocrisy”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Kevin McCarthy </strong>was no closer to becoming Speaker of America’s House of Representatives after losing a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/04/what-the-kevin-mccarthy-saga-means-for-americas-congress">tenth vote</a>—making this the most protracted election since 1859. Twenty right-wing Republican holdouts have refused to accept his concessions. “The deal is over with him. He does not have the votes”, said Lauren Boebert, one of the rebels. Mr McCarthy needs to win over at least sixteen.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>Biden administration</strong> said it would begin <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/12/20/title-42-might-be-nixed">rapidly expelling</a> <strong>migrants</strong>, including asylum-seekers, from Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua at its border with Mexico. Until now they were exempt from expulsion, unlike citizens from other countries, since Mexico had refused to accept them. But Mexico will now take 30,000 from each country a month. The same number can apply to enter America if sponsored by an American.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Crypto’s</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto">woes</a> worsened as two firms reported big layoffs. Genesis Trading, a lender, cut 30% of its workforce and could reportedly face bankruptcy; the firm had counted Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried’s now-defunct trading firm, as a client. Silvergate, a bank, saw its share price nearly halve after it sacked 200 employees. Separately, New York’s attorney-general filed civil fraud charges against the co-founder of the bankrupt Celsius Network.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Mexico’s</strong> army arrested <strong>Ovidio Guzmán L</strong><strong>ó</strong><strong>pez</strong>, a son of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2018/11/16/the-trial-of-el-chapo-and-the-crime-fighting-plan-of-amlo">Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán</a> and an alleged fentanyl trafficker, in the state of Sinaloa. A high-ranking member of the drug cartel that his father once ran, Mr Guzmán López was briefly captured in 2019. But after his gang retaliated violently, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ordered his release in an embarrassing reversal. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ales Bialiatski</strong>, a Belarusian human-rights activist who shared the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/07/the-nobel-peace-prize-recognises-human-rights-groups-that-spoke-truth-to-putinism">Nobel Peace prize</a> in 2022, went on trial in Minsk, Belarus’s capital. Mr Bialiatski was arrested during protests against Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s dictatorial president, in 2021. He is accused of smuggling money, charges his supporters say are simply designed to quash dissent. He could face 12 years in prison. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The funeral of <strong>Benedict XVI</strong>, pope from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, took place in the Vatican, presided over by his successor Pope Francis. Before the ceremony, about 200,000 people had queued to see <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/12/31/pope-benedict-xvi-was-an-iron-fist-in-a-white-glove" data-tegid="vltatvjrdnqlkmir505m3c5df6kh0p1d">Benedict’s</a> body lying in state.

<h3>Tech’s annual jamboree in Sin City</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday the Consumer Electronics Show kicks off in Las Vegas. Some 100,000 people from over 170 countries are expected to take the opportunity to play with the latest gadgetry from more than 3,000 companies. As well as the usual launches of consumer-tech products, the glitzy event will see carmakers <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/01/08/cars-meet-chips-in-sin-city">showcasing flashy new features</a>. In 2022, GM and Mercedes-Benz announced innovations to their electric vehicles. One attraction this year will be a race around the Las Vegas Speedway between cars driven by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the show comes at a rough time for the tech industry. Share prices were battered in 2022; the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/24/how-techs-defiance-of-economic-gravity-came-to-an-abrupt-end">fell</a> by about one-quarter. Firms from Amazon to Zillow have announced layoffs. And 2023 offers little hope for a rebound: analysts forecast that 40 of the world’s 100 biggest technology firms will see revenues shrink. That is no mood for a party, even in Vegas.</p>
<h3>Mounting tensions in Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A visit by Israel’s national-security minister to one of the world’s most contentious religious sites has highlighted the radical tendencies of Binyamin Netanyahu’s new government. On Tuesday <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker">Itamar Ben-Gvir</a>, leader of an ultra-nationalist party in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition, visited Jerusalem’s Temple Mount, near the al-Aqsa mosque, despite warnings of violent protests. So far these have not materialised. But the action, condemned by Arab regimes, has led the United Arab Emirates to postpone a proposed visit by Mr Netanyahu that had been scheduled for next week.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Ben-Gvir’s portfolio gives him control of police and a new paramilitary “national guard”, while other far-right ministers plan to expand the construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank. That risks further escalating tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, is now beholden to his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics">firebrand partners</a> and finding it difficult to rein them in.</p>
<h3>North Korea’s nuclear weapons</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">North Korea started the year with a bang, testing a “super-large multiple rocket system”. Kim Jong Un, the country’s dictator, boasted that it could carry a nuclear payload to anywhere on the Korean peninsula. He also called for an “exponential increase” in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This suggests that North Korea intends to spend 2023 as it did the previous year: testing new weapons and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many">honing its ability to use them</a>. The stock response from South Korea and America—issuing stern threats and matching North Korean muscle-flexing with reciprocal displays of force—is also unlikely to change. Far from de-escalating, Yoon Suk-yeul, South Korea’s president, has said the country should consider suspending a five-year-old agreement with North Korea that limits military exercises. Seventy years after the armistice that silenced the guns of the Korean war in 1953, peace seems a distant prospect.</p>
<h3>A death-penalty case in South Carolina</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Lethal injection can be a gruesome way to die. In America, where it is the main <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/15/south-carolina-wants-to-execute-an-inmate-by-firing-squad">method of capital punishment</a>, such executions are often botched. Drug manufacturers, wanting nothing to do with the practice, have largely stopped supplying the necessary ingredients. That has left some states scrambling for alternatives. In 2020 South Carolina joined Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah in allowing executions by firing squad—a rare method used to execute only three people since 1976, all in Utah—when lethal injections are unavailable.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Richard Moore, a death-row inmate faced with a choice between firing squad and South Carolina’s 110-year-old electric chair, argues that neither method is constitutional. On Thursday the state’s supreme court will consider whether he can be executed by firing squad. Whatever the court decides, such cases will only hasten a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/21/use-of-the-death-penalty-in-america-may-be-ending">reconsidering of capital punishment</a> in America altogether. Thirty-seven states have either abolished the death penalty or executed no prisoners in more than a decade. Capital punishment may be approaching its last gasp.</p>
<h3>Dhaka Lit Fest is back</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Since it began in 2011, the annual celebration of Bangladesh’s literary culture has faced some severe challenges. Most notably, in 2015 many speakers dropped out following a spate of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2015/05/14/the-third-casualty">attacks on secular writers</a> by machete-wielding Islamists. Since then the avowedly secular festival has pitted itself as a defender of free speech in a publishing industry dominated by Islamic books and religious censorship.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">After a three-year covid hiatus, on Thursday the festival returned with an impressive line-up. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2021/10/07/abdulrazak-gurnah-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-literature-for-2021">Abdulrazak Gurnah</a>, a Nobel-prizewinning author and Tilda Swinton, a British actress, join acclaimed South Asian writers such as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/08/18/shehan-karunatilaka-returns-with-another-thrilling-satire">Shehan Karunatilaka</a>, Amitav Ghosh, Saad Z. Hossain and Geetanjali Shree, who won the International Booker prize in 2022.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But organisers face a backlash against newly introduced ticket prices. And critics charge that the festival fails to address the<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/03/27/as-it-turns-50-bangladesh-is-doing-well-despite-its-politicians"> government’s </a>draconian <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/03/06/indias-government-follows-bangladeshs-in-policing-social-media">censorship laws</a>. Speaking out, though, risks the event, sponsored by the culture ministry, being cancelled for good.</p>
