<p class="customisedFont">At the end of a meeting of <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> Western and NATO allies at the Ramstein air base in Germany, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/20/a-meeting-in-germany-approves-more-arms-for-ukraine-but-no-leopard-tanks">no decision was reached</a> on sending Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, despite <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/11/the-west-should-supply-tanks-to-ukraine">pleas</a> from President Volodymyr Zelensky to do so. Nonetheless, several countries pledged to send more military aid. <strong>America </strong>will send a package worth around $2.5bn, including 90 Stryker combat vehicles. Britain had previously promised to send 14 Challenger 2 tanks.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Chris Hipkins, who oversaw <strong>New Zealand’s</strong> pandemic response under Jacinda Ardern, will replace her as leader of the Labour Party and thus prime minister following her <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2023/01/19/jacinda-ardern-resigns-as-new-zealands-prime-minister">surprise resignation</a>. Labour lawmakers will confirm his accession on Sunday. Mr Hipkins, aged 44, currently serves as education minister and was the only candidate to stand for the job. A general election is due in October.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Google’s parent company <strong>Alphabet</strong> announced that it <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/24/how-techs-defiance-of-economic-gravity-came-to-an-abrupt-end">will cut</a> 12,000 jobs, or around 6% of its workforce. Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, said that the company, which has hired thousands of people in recent years, now faces a “different economic reality”. The announcement comes days after Microsoft, another <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/10/as-tech-lay-offs-spread-meta-sacks-11000-workers">tech firm</a>, said that it would lay off 10,000 of its staff.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia</strong> could start selling <strong>oil</strong> to <strong>Pakistan</strong>, with an agreement likely to come by March, Russia’s energy minister said. Payment will be in the currency of “friendly” countries—meaning those that do not levy sanctions against Russia. Pakistan <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets">typically imports</a> most of its oil from the Gulf. But amid a severe balance-of-payments crisis, it is eager to take advantage of the discount for Russian crude. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> said it will designate the <strong>Wagner Group</strong>, a Russian <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation">firm of private mercenaries</a>, a transnational criminal organisation and level sanctions against it. America thinks Wagner has 50,000 fighters in Ukraine. The White House also released a photo, taken in November, showing Russian railcars travelling between Russia and North Korea, transporting what America said were weapons for use in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>British retail sales</strong> volumes fell by 1% in December, as shoppers tightened their belts amid <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/12/15/britains-economic-record-since-2007-ranks-near-the-bottom-among-peer-countries">high inflation and rising interest rates</a>. Monthly food sales volumes fell by 0.3%, following an increase of 1% in November, as annual food inflation hit 16.9%. John Allan, the boss of Tesco, a British supermarket chain, said the government needs a “really serious” long-term growth plan.<br/></p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>Dutch</strong> government said it would seek to ban the ownership of <strong>pet breeds</strong> that, because of their appearance, frequently suffer health problems such as belaboured breathing. Owners, said the agriculture minister, are “unaware of the dark side of their pets’ appearance”. In 2019 the Netherlands outlawed <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/what-makes-certain-dogs-popular-in-certain-countries">breeding dogs</a> with muzzles less than one-third the length of their skull, including flat-faced pekingese and French bulldogs.</p>

<h3>Biden’s uneven anniversary</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In January 2022 Tom Hanks narrated a video celebrating Joe Biden’s first year as president. The actor’s steely optimism sent a message of improvement: covid-19 is fading and the economy is inching back. On Friday Mr Biden marks two years in office. There are still victories—including <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/08/americas-climate-plus-spending-bill-is-flawed-but-essential">climate legislation</a>, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/10/27/joe-biden-attempts-the-biggest-overhaul-of-americas-economy-in-decades">infrastructure</a> investment and better-than-expected <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/09/the-democrats-have-done-better-than-expected">midterm elections</a>—but the story is no longer one of linear progress. The pandemic often feels distant, but covid-19 kills 2,000 Americans each week. Inflation is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">coming down</a>, but still high. Fears of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/04/is-a-white-collar-recession-looming">recession</a> loom.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Then there are around 20 <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2023/01/13/the-presidential-mislaying-of-classified-documents-is-infectious" data-tegid="u4ugv7d7dkmt6q3su6j9qv2bfcg07m5l">classified documents</a> from Mr Biden’s time as Barack Obama’s vice-president which were discovered in places they should not be. In this scandal Mr Biden cannot avoid comparison to Donald Trump, the former president who took over 300 sensitive documents home. As both men prepare bids for re-election in 2024, matching investigations into carelessness, or worse, over state secrets have added an unexpected twist—and cost Mr Biden the moral high ground.</p>
<h3>Germany’s reluctance to send Leopards</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A showdown looms at a meeting in Germany on Friday of the Ukraine contact group, a gathering of senior defence officials from 50-odd countries arming Ukraine. Many countries want to send Western tanks to help Ukraine regain momentum against Russia. Germany is refusing to send its (German-made) Leopard tanks, or give other countries the permission they need to send theirs. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine is pleading for capable <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/11/the-west-should-supply-tanks-to-ukraine">Western tanks</a>. Britain has promised 14 Challengers. But Germany says it will release the Leopards only if America sends Abrams tanks, too. This is military nonsense: the Leopard is easier to operate than the Abrams and is plentiful, with some 2,000 in service across Europe. Germany seems caught in a political tank-trap. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Immediately before the meeting, the American defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, promised to send Patriot air-defence systems and armoured personnel carriers, but failed to mention tanks. It might be a long day at the Ramstein air base in Germany.</p>
<h3>Yellen and Lavrov head to Africa</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">January has been a busy month for red-carpet rollers in Africa. Both the Chinese and Turkish foreign ministers took five-country tours. Next week their <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/12/why-russia-wins-some-sympathy-in-africa-and-the-middle-east">Russian</a> counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, will arrive in South Africa. So when Janet Yellen meets Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, on Friday, America’s treasury secretary will be part of a global competition for influence.<br/><br/> Not that America frames it that way. The Biden administration, in contrast to that of Donald Trump, talks of partnering with African countries, rather than viewing them as pawns in a struggle for influence between global powers. Following the US-Africa Summit in December American officials are keen to show they are listening to Africans’ concerns. These are mostly economic. More than half of the continent’s 35 low-income countries are in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/30/debt-repayment-costs-are-rising-fast-for-many-african-countries">debt distress</a> or at high risk of becoming so, according to the IMF. Ms Yellen’s trip—which will also include visits to Zambia and South Africa—is well timed, but she is in a crowded field.</p>
<h3>China’s economy enters a new year</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Less than a year ago Chinese stocks, specifically those of the tech companies that once beguiled foreign investors, were deemed <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/05/19/is-china-uninvestible">“uninvestable”</a> by some analysts. They argued that these assets had become almost impossible to value, thanks to capricious regulations and febrile <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/20/america-tries-to-nobble-chinas-tech-industry-again">geopolitics</a>.<br/><br/> It turns out foreign investors can stomach a mercurial policy as long as it zags their way. China’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/06/china-is-dismantling-its-zero-covid-machine">abandonment</a> of its zero-covid regime was abrupt, ill-planned and wholeheartedly applauded by equity <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2023/01/07/what-chinas-reopening-means-for-the-world-economy">markets</a>. But as the year of the tiger draws to a close, a benchmark equity index has risen by 20% since the end of October.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Threats remain. In a survey of Asia fund managers by Bank of America, 45% said geopolitics was the biggest risk to Chinese assets. But as the year of the rabbit begins, investors have decided it is the wrong time to hide in a foxhole.</p>

<h3>A new single from a female supergroup</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">If you were to assemble a supergroup of songstresses, you would struggle to put together a stronger lineup than the one Diane Warren has forged. The Grammy award-winning American songwriter brought together Belinda Carlisle, Gloria Estefan, Debbie Harry, Cyndi Lauper and Dolly Parton to record “Gonna Be You”, which is released on Friday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The song appears on the soundtrack of “80 for Brady”, a film about a group of older women (pictured) bound together by their love of American football (and a certain star quarterback named Tom in particular). Asked to write a song, Ms Warren was inspired by the film’s spirit of female friendship, and the title, to ask “some of the most iconic singers from the 80s” to perform it. In that she succeeded. Over decades in the industry the five singers have sold hundreds of millions of records between them. Few teams have benefited from so many star players.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 GMT on Friday to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@te.arielherself.xyz"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0c5d796576497f7c7e697f7f634c696f63626361657f78226f6361">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown one winner per continent on Saturday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Friday: </strong>Which American ski resort hosts both the Winter X games and a centre for physics?<br/><strong>Thursday:</strong> Which right-wing pressure group was founded by Robert Welch junior in 1958?</p>
