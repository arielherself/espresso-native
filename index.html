<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Stockmarkets</strong> rallied after annual <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/03/does-high-inflation-matter">inflation</a> in <strong>America</strong> eased slightly in July, dipping to 8.5% from 9.1% in June. Markets are hoping that the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/the-federal-reserve-is-causing-pain-in-financial-markets/21809132">Federal Reserve</a> will now temper its interest-rate increases. The Nasdaq composite index gained nearly 3% on the news, and closed more than 20% higher than its nadir in mid-June. Asian stockmarkets also rose during early trading on Thursday. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Donald Trump</strong> refused to answer questions under oath while being deposed by the New York state attorney-general as part of a civil investigation into his family’s business accounts. Mr Trump said in a statement that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The investigation runs parallel to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm">one by the FBI</a> allegedly related to Mr Trump’s activities after he left office. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Kim Jong Un</strong> declared that <strong>North Korea</strong> has overcome the outbreak of <strong>covid-19</strong> which it <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/05/17/covid-19-is-spreading-like-wildfire-in-north-korea">finally admitted to in May</a>. Meanwhile the dictator’s sister said Mr Kim was among the almost five million North Koreans who suffered from a “fever” (the country never provided the numbers of actual covid cases). She also claimed that leaflets scattered near the border by South Koreans caused the infections. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Sierra Leone</strong> imposed a nationwide curfew after mass protests against the government turned violent. Living costs in the country <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/06/23/costly-food-and-energy-are-fostering-global-unrest">have soared recently</a> and fuel is extremely expensive. On Wednesday thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Freetown, the capital, with some throwing rocks and setting tyres on fire. At least two police officers and one civilian are reported to have died.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> announced an end to military <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/05/the-crisis-over-taiwan-is-yet-another-test-for-xi-jinping">drills</a> around <strong>Taiwan</strong> but said regular patrols would continue in the Taiwan Strait. Separately, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office published its first white paper on Taiwan in 22 years. Compared with older versions of the document from 1993 and 2000, the new paper drops China’s previous promise not to deploy its soldiers in Taiwan after it has been “reunified” with the mainland.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Softbank</strong> said it would reduce its stake in <strong>Alibaba</strong>, a Chinese e-commerce giant, by unloading $22bn-worth of shares. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/06/17/hard-truths-about-softbank">Japanese investment group</a> said its holdings in the company would shrink to 14.6% in September, down from 23.7% at the end of June. The decision came two days after Softbank posted its largest-ever quarterly loss, of $23.4bn, prompting Son Masayoshi, the firm’s boss, to say that “dramatic” cost-cutting was on the cards. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Disney’s</strong> revenues soared by 26% in the latest quarter, thanks in large part to strong demand for its theme parks, which have bounced back from their pandemic doldrums with a vengeance. Disney+, the company’s streaming service, also added millions more subscribers than expected. Even so, Disney said it will raise its streaming prices to hedge against <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591">slower subscriber growth</a> in future.</p>

<h3>Inflation down but not out in America</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">After months of soaring inflation, America may get a partial reprieve. In data for July, released on Wednesday, consumer prices rose by 8.5% year-on-year, down from a four-decade high of 9.1% in June. That is likely to prompt discussion of whether America has finally passed peak inflation.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The details of the data are more sobering. A fall in oil prices—down more than 10% in July from June—accounted for much of the headline decline in inflation. Take out volatile food and energy costs, and inflation remained too hot for comfort. Moreover, nominal wages are also still rising strongly, generating yet more upward pressure on prices. Markets had hoped the Federal Reserve might be able to slow the pace of its interest-rate increases. But with inflation like this, it may not want to let up.</p>
<h3>Republicans rally around Trump</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The raid may have been shocking; the response was not. On Monday, the FBI searched Donald Trump’s Florida estate, reportedly part of an inquiry into whether the former president had mishandled classified material after leaving office. The raid <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm">could suggest</a> that evidence of a federal crime lurked in Mr Trump’s estate. Merrick Garland, the attorney-general, is not one for taking bold steps based on whims.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><br/> This is only one of many legal threats Mr Trump faces. On Wednesday he will be questioned under oath as part of an investigation in New York into his businesses accounts. Yet it may help unite Republicans around him. After the raid Republican congressmen vowed to investigate the investigators, should the party win a majority in the House of Representatives at the mid-terms in November. Mr Trump called the raid a “weaponisation” of the justice system, intended to to derail another potential presidential bid. His enduring political influence is already visible in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/03/donald-trumps-preferred-candidates-sweep-to-victory-in-arizona">Republican primaries</a> across the country. According to Politico, a news website, insiders think the raid will, if anything, accelerate Mr Trump’s decision to run again in 2024. And he is already using outrage about the raid to solicit donations for his “Save America” campaign.</p>
<h3>Europe bans Russian coal</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The European Union’s ban on imports of Russian coal, agreed in April as part of its fifth package of sanctions, takes effect at midnight on Wednesday. One of the world’s biggest exporters of the black stuff, Russia supplied around 70% of the EU’s imports of thermal coal (used to generate electricity) and 45% of all coal imports last year, according to Bruegel, a think-tank in Brussels.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><br/> Yet coal matters less to the Kremlin than gas or oil. Of the €94.3bn ($96.5bn) that the EU spent on Russian fuel last year, just €5.3bn ($5.4bn) went on coal. Ukraine’s government would like the EU to go much faster restricting other fuel sources. But a planned embargo on oil will come fully into force only next year. And the EU has so far imposed no restrictions on Russian natural gas at all, other than asking its members to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/28/the-eu-agrees-on-an-energy-diet-to-fight-russian-gas-cuts">use less of it</a>. Instead, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter">cutting gas exports</a> to try to blackmail Europe into relaxing sanctions.</p>
<h3>A cruel summer for TUI?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>A cruel summer for TUI?</strong></p>
<p class="customisedFont">While much of Europe basks on summer holiday, TUI—the travel giant that will have organised many of those trips—reported its third quarter earnings. A costly hit from flight disruptions this summer left it with an operating loss of €27m ($27m), following two years of travel disruptions caused by covid-19. The outlook looks somewhat brighter though, with future bookings close to pre-pandemic levels.<br/><br/> The German firm, which owns 1,600 travel agencies and five airlines, suffered from the ravages inflicted on the travel sector by the pandemic. It has struggled with irate customers upset by this summer’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/07/05/why-british-holiday-makers-should-brace-for-more-misery-this-summer">travel chaos</a>, as thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled. And looming recessions in Germany and Britain could hit the group hard. Further turbulence might come from the departure of Fritz Joussen, the group’s chief executive, who announced his resignation in June after a successful ten-year stint. His successor will take over a ship that is yet to be steadied.</p>
<h3>The Chess Olympiad concludes</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In Mahabalipuram, a sleepy Indian town some 40km from Chennai, over 2,000 players from 187 countries have been battling in the Chess Olympiad, the game’s top international team event. As the teams depart on Wednesday, Uzbek and Ukrainian players will be particularly happy: they won the men’s and women’s categories respectively.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">As rooks and knights jousted on the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2015/06/15/chess">chessboard</a>, there was action away from it, too. On August 7th Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister, was re-elected as the president of the International Chess Federation, which organises the Olympiad, winning a landslide victory over Andrii Baryshpolets, a Ukrainian grandmaster. Mr Dvorkovich’s re-election is controversial. Though he initially decried Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—an action described as a “​​national betrayal” by a Russian MP—he later released a statement praising his country’s soldiers. Russia now calls him “our candidate”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">For all that, despite Mr Dvorkovich’s position, his countrymen are still banned from the federation’s competitions. Soft power only goes so far.</p>
