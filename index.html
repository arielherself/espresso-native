A caucus of 20 hard-right Republicans had initially blocked his path, but a swathe of concessions, including allowing a single lawmaker to force a vote on ousting the speaker, eventually persuaded enough of them to drop their opposition.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There appeared little sign that a unilateral 36-hour <strong>ceasefire in Ukraine</strong>, announced by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/23/making-sense-of-vladimir-putins-war">the Kremlin</a> to mark Orthodox Christmas, was holding. Shelling by Russian troops in occupied territories was reported in the east. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called the promised cessation a tactical ploy. Meanwhile a Ukrainian military chief told the <em>Guardian</em> that Russia was planning to mobilise another 500,000 conscripts for a summer assault.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Jack Ma</strong> will give up control of <strong>Ant Group</strong>, the Chinese fintech group he founded, as the firm sets its sights on a public listing.

A new listing would suggest the government’s subsequent <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2021/08/14/xi-jinpings-assault-on-tech-will-change-chinas-trajectory">tech crackdown</a> is being relaxed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>American jobs growth</strong> fell in December as high interest rates cooled the labour market, a consequence of the Federal Reserve’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">ongoing battle</a> against high inflation. America added 223,000 jobs last month, official statistics showed, compared with 256,000 in November. Still, the unemployment rate dipped from 3.6% to 3.5%. That means the Fed is likely to continue its aggressive monetary policy.</p>

The regulator directed the drug, called lecanemab, to be labelled for patients in early and mild stages of Alzheimer’s. In 2021 the FDA approved a different Alzheimer’s drug and was widely <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2021/06/12/americas-approval-of-an-alzheimers-drug-is-premature">criticised</a> for doing so prematurely.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Euro zone inflation </strong>slowed more than anticipated in December, helped by a drop in gas prices.

<h3>A divided Orthodox Christmas</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For most Christians, the last traces of Christmas will be gone by Saturday. Some consider it bad luck to keep up decorations after Epiphany, on Friday. But members of the Orthodox Church, the dominant religion in Russia and Ukraine, will be celebrating. They follow the Julian calendar, rather than the more-popular Gregorian, so Christmas Day falls on Saturday. Russia ordered a brief ceasefire in its war to mark the occasion, though fighting has continued.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But many Ukrainians have already celebrated the nativity. For the first time, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), one of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/01/06/why-did-the-russian-and-ukrainian-orthodox-churches-split">two main Orthodox churches</a> in the country, allowed the faithful to mark Christmas on December 25th.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">That sets the OCU at odds with the Russian Orthodox Church and with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), the country’s other main church. Until May the UOC fell under the authority of the Russian church. Many still view it as a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/11/ukraines-orthodox-churches-and-the-fight-for-the-countrys-soul">fifth column</a>. This Christmas is unlikely to bring much unity.</p>
<h3>Facebook’s de-platforming decision</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The morning after the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/06/trumps-supporters-storm-the-capitol-to-block-the-transfer-of-power">Capitol riot</a>, Mark Zuckerberg indefinitely suspended Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. Mr Trump had used the sites to “condone rather than condemn” that day’s violence, said the social-media firms’ boss. The ban was later shortened to two years, with the possibility of his re-platforming if the “risk to public safety” had diminished. The two-year mark comes on Saturday; a verdict about whether to reinstate Mr Trump is expected later this month.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The choice is thorny, though arguably less consequential than one might think. First, the former president may choose not to post, preferring Truth Social, his own platform. Mr Trump has stayed mum on Twitter since Elon Musk welcomed him back to that site in November. Second, he is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/12/18/donald-trumps-popularity-with-republican-voters-is-sinking">much diminished</a> as a political figure, especially after his chosen candidates’ <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/after-the-midterms-america-and-its-democracy-look-stronger">dismal showing</a> at the midterm elections. His pronouncements, put simply, matter less than they once did. </p>
<h3>Covid surveillance is faltering</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Three years ago this week scientists in China isolated the first strain of the novel coronavirus that would spawn the covid-19 pandemic. Again all eyes are on China: the country has stopped reporting reliable data on cases and deaths, just as it faces the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/01/05/china-is-overwhelmed-yet-an-even-bigger-covid-wave-may-be-coming">world’s biggest wave of infections</a>. That is stoking worries that if a scary new variant emerges there, other countries will be unaware until their hospitals fill up.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But variants can appear anywhere. More infections increase the chances of that, and covid is spreading freely around the world. About 2% of people in Britain, for example, had covid on any given day in recent months. The latest—and most contagious—offshoot of the Omicron variant, called XBB.1.5, probably originated in America. Sharing genomic sequences is the first step to dealing with new variants. But as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2023/01/04/all-around-the-world-covid-surveillance-is-faltering">countries abandon testing</a>, such surveillance is winding down. That is what the world should worry about most.</p>
<h3>Prince Harry’s agonistes</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">There must be some very irritated Netflix executives. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/12/15/why-do-harry-and-meghan-wind-people-up">Six agonising hours</a> of their royal docusoap offered little more than cashmere, California and platitudes. By contrast, even before its official publication on Tuesday, leaks from Prince Harry’s new book, “Spare”, have offered revelations about him losing his virginity to an older woman in a field (he “mounted her quickly”; she “spanked” him); tripping on magic mushrooms (he imagined that a pedal bin spoke); and a description of how his father broke the news about Diana’s death (there was no hug).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Perhaps most sensationally, Harry has revealed that during a fight in which Prince William called his wife Meghan “difficult” and “rude”, his brother grabbed him “by the collar, ripping my necklace, and…knocked me to the floor.” Until that moment, few had probably realised that the fifth in line to the throne still wore a necklace.</p>
<h3>Weekend Profile: Andriy Kostin, Ukraine’s prosecutor with a plan</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Few would envy Andriy Kostin, Ukraine’s newish prosecutor-general. His office is short on armoured vehicles, bulletproof vests and kit to detect landmines, which he calls “a real threat” to his officers in the field. His office has nonetheless recorded more than 60,000 alleged Russian <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/04/08/as-russian-soldiers-retreat-they-leave-evidence-of-war-crimes">war crimes</a>, ranging from torture and executions to strikes on over 400 medical facilities. Allies have lent him investigators, but with only about 200 Ukrainian war-crimes prosecutors, the team is stretched thin. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">An inauspicious discovery led to Mr Kostin’s appointment, in July. His predecessor was dismissed after numerous prosecutorial officials were suspected of collaborating with Russia. But Mr Kostin, a law graduate of Odessa National University, is himself not entirely free of controversy. In 2021 Mr Kostin’s candidacy to lead an anti-corruption arm of the institution he now runs failed. Watchdogs saw “significant violations” in his ethical conduct, including two visits to occupied Crimea, failure to report a sale of real estate to a different anti-corruption body, and “possible nepotism”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Kostin now dismisses the matter as a “historical question”; in the present, he is crafting a bold agenda. He describes Russia’s war as genocide, noting that Russian officials have spoken of “de-Ukrainisation”. He says some 14,000 cases of Ukrainian children being forcibly taken to Russia and Belarus amount to “stealing” Ukraine’s future. Mr Kostin believes that most cases of Russian war crimes can be tried in Ukrainian courts. They have already convicted 21 people of war crimes, some in absentia. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">More ambitiously, Mr Kostin would also like to see Russia’s top leaders tried for aggression against Ukraine, but neither Ukraine nor the International Criminal Court have the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/04/04/how-if-at-all-might-russia-be-punished-for-its-war-crimes-in-ukraine">legal authority</a> to do so. Mr Kostin is therefore lobbying hard for the creation of a special international tribunal, possibly by a vote of the UN’s general assembly—no small undertaking. The tribunal’s priority would be to try Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Many countries will hesitate to lend support. But outrage over Russia’s war, Mr Kostin says, is steadily building the necessary political capital. If Mr Kostin succeeds, he will have made his mark on history.</p>
