<p class="customisedFont">At least 146 people died in a <strong>crush</strong> during Halloween celebrations in Seoul, the capital of <strong>South Korea</strong>. Another 150 were injured. The president, Yoon Suk-yeol, chaired an emergency meeting after the tragedy, which took place in the Itaewon district, a popular area for nightlife.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia’s</strong> defence ministry said that the country would suspend a deal allowing <strong>grain exports</strong> from Ukrainian ports, claiming that Ukrainian drones had attacked ships from its Black Sea Fleet taking part in the initiative. On Friday António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, had urged that the agreement, which was reached in July and is due to expire next month, be extended.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong> has reportedly ordered <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">staff cuts</a> at <strong>Twitter</strong>. The layoffs are expected to happen by Tuesday, according to the <em>New York Times</em>, which is when employees’ stock options vest. By sacking staff before then Mr Musk may manage to avoid paying that compensation. It’s unclear how many employees will get the axe, though previous reports suggested he could cull 75% of the social-media firm’s 7,500 staff.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The head of <strong>Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps</strong>, the Islamic republic’s praetorian body, said that Saturday would be the “last day of the riots” and warned protesters not to go to the streets. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/26/will-irans-women-win">Iranians</a> have been demanding an end to the regime after the death in custody last month of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by the “morality police”. Security forces are cracking down; hundreds have been killed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Joe Biden condemned as “despicable” an assault on the husband of <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>, the Speaker of America’s House of Representatives. Police arrested a hammer-wielding intruder who broke into the Pelosis’ San Francisco home and demanded: “Where is Nancy?” The attack comes days before the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/10/20/american-democracy-is-under-threat">midterm elections</a> and amid a grim spike in threats against lawmakers. Paul Pelosi, who is 82, underwent surgery and is recovering in hospital.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Two <strong>car-bombs</strong> caused “scores of civilian casualties” in Mogadishu, <strong>Somalia’s</strong> capital, local police said. The attack came as Somalia’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/07/19/somalias-president-wants-help-to-fight-africas-terrorist-groups">president</a>, prime minister and other officials met to discuss combating violent extremists—in particular, those of al-Shabab, a jihadist group affiliated with al-Qaeda. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts. An al-Shabab truck-bomb at the same place in 2017 killed more than 500 people.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Poland</strong> chose Westinghouse, an American company, to build its first <strong>nuclear power plant</strong> as the country seeks to burn less coal, cutting air pollution and emissions, and to strengthen its energy security. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/06/23/energy-security-gives-climate-friendly-nuclear-power-plants-a-new-appeal">Westinghouse</a> beat out competition from French and South Korean firms.

<h3>Barack Obama rallies Democrats</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s former president hits the campaign trail this weekend. Barack Obama will appear at a rally in Detroit alongside Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who is seeking re-election in the midterms in November. In Milwaukee he will stump with Tony Evers, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/06/why-wisconsin-has-such-odd-politics">Wisconsin’s</a> Democratic governor, and Mandela Barnes, the party’s nominee for the Senate. On Friday he appeared in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/13/georgias-races-suggest-good-candidates-can-beat-partisan-reflexes">Georgia</a> with Stacey Abrams and Raphael Warnock, candidates for governor and the Senate respectively. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Obama’s hectic campaigning spree is rare: in recent years he has devoted himself less to politics and more to pursuits such as making a nature documentary for Netflix. His activity contrasts with that of President Joe Biden, who has not appeared at a campaign rally in months (though he has done more low-key events). Mr Biden evidently fears that his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/president-joe-biden-polls">unpopularity</a>—53% of voters disapprove of him—might put off undecided voters. Mr Obama’s appearance, by contrast, might help boost turnout, particularly among black voters.</p>
<h3>A concerning countdown to COP27</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Next month countries gather for the United Nations’ climate summit in Egypt. In preparation, this week several reports assessed their progress in tackling <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/10/27/few-governments-have-done-much-about-the-climate-this-year">climate change</a>. The conclusions are grim. The UN Environment Programme found that countries’ climate commitments barely made a dent in the 17bn to 20bn tonnes that must be cut from annual emissions by 2030 for any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5°C over pre-industrial temperatures (the primary goal of the Paris Agreement). Even if every national climate goal for 2030 were met, models predict temperatures will rise by 2.4°C by 2100. Existing climate policies (not just promises) equal 2.8°C.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A report from Systems Change Lab, a collection of environmental groups and think-tanks, found that of 40 actions needed to meet 2030 targets—such as changing energy systems and land use—none are on track. There was one bright spot: a report from the International Energy Agency found that war in Ukraine has hastened the world’s transition to renewable energy.</p>
<h3>Mexicans celebrate Day of the Dead</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday Mexicans will begin celebrating <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/27/the-joys-of-pan-de-muerto-a-sweet-tribute-to-departed-loved-ones">Día de los Muertos</a>, the lively festival of ancestors that runs over several days. Mexico City will host a huge parade of costumed people and papier-mâché figures. Crowds will flock to the <em>ofrenda</em> (altar) in the Zócalo, the capital’s central square, a larger version of the personal ones they set up at home. Graveyards become rammed and rambunctious.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Day of the Dead is rooted in pre-Hispanic cultures. People place food, sugar skulls and marigolds on altars and graves, which they believe will help speed their loved ones’ journey to their final resting place. Outside Mexico the event’s popularity is relatively recent, and is in part for having been featured in “Spectre”, a James Bond instalment, and “Coco”, an animated Disney film. Mexico is a country with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/06/30/at-least-100000-people-are-missing-in-mexico">far too much experience of death</a>, but this festival is anything but morbid.</p>
<h3>The horrors of the first world war, on film</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday Netflix released “All Quiet on the Western Front”, a film based on the novel by Erich Maria Remarque that was published in 1929. It is the first German adaptation of the anti-war classic, which is more topical than ever at a time when <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis">conflict is again raging in Europe</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The story recounts how, in the spring of 1917, a 17-year-old German soldier, Paul Bäumer, lies about his age to join the war. He and his friends dream about conquering Paris and celebrating victory. Then the brutal reality sets in: when they arrive at the western front they witness dehumanising carnage in muddy trenches. Their enthusiasm turns to abject horror and fear. The well-reviewed film, which is also showing in German cinemas, is Germany’s submission for next year’s Academy Award for best international feature film.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Li Qiang, China’s probable next prime minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It is now all but certain who China’s next prime minister will be. On October 23rd, when Xi Jinping walked onto a podium in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People with members of his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/27/xi-jinping-has-surrounded-himself-with-loyalists">reshuffled leadership team</a>, the man directly behind him was Li Qiang, the Communist Party chief of Shanghai. That meant the 63-year-old Mr Li, whose promotion prospects many analysts had written off just a few months ago, had become China’s highest-ranking politician after Mr Xi. He is expected to take over from Li Keqiang (no relation), the 67-year-old current prime minister, when the legislature meets next March.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The younger Mr Li is a remarkable choice. Earlier this year he was widely blamed by Shanghai residents for the chaotic and harsh management of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/04/09/a-clumsy-lockdown-of-shanghai-is-testing-the-zero-covid-strategy">weeks-long lockdown</a> of the city, aimed at crushing an outbreak of covid-19. Even without the lockdown fiasco, he would have been an unlikely candidate for prime minister. The post is normally given to people who have served as a deputy PM. Li Qiang has never held a central-government portfolio.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But it is clear why Mr Xi likes him. In the 2000s, when Mr Xi was the party boss of the coastal province of Zhejiang, Li Qiang was his chief of staff. Enforcing strict lockdown measures in Shanghai may have further endeared him to China’s leader, who has just secured a norm-breaking third term as the party’s general secretary and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. (Mr Xi has been a keen advocate of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/13/china-shows-few-signs-of-loosening-its-zero-covid-policy">“zero-covid” approach</a> to crushing the virus.) </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Li is liked by many businessmen, but foreign investors were spooked by the reshuffle and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/25/xi-jinping-provokes-a-spectacular-sell-off-in-chinas-markets">dumped Chinese shares</a>. They worried that Mr Xi had surrounded himself with yes-men who would do little to curb his dirigiste instincts. In truth, Mr Xi’s power has long been subject to little restraint from colleagues. The promotion of Mr Li and other loyalists may not do much more to embolden him.</p>
