<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Taiwan</strong> accused <strong>China</strong> of conducting exercises simulating an invasion of the island on the third day of its most-provocative military drills in decades. China had previously <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan">fired missiles</a> over Taipei, the island’s capital, and sent warships across the Taiwan Strait’s median line. Talks with America on several topics were halted following the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning">visit</a> of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, to <strong>Taiwan</strong> on Tuesday.</p>

The near-total ban will allow termination only in cases of rape or incest, to protect the mother’s health or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. It will go into effect from September 15th.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Israeli</strong> air strikes on the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> continued in the early hours of Saturday morning, while militants fired rockets towards Israel in response. An Israli attack hours earlier had reportedly killed at least ten people, including a commander Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group, and a young girl. The fighting followed rising tension after the arrest of a PIJ member in the occupied West Bank.</p>

Employers added 528,000 jobs, taking the level of employment above its pre-pandemic level and assuaging fears that the economy was falling into a recession. The news could give the Federal Reserve more reason to raise interest rates further in its campaign to slow inflation.</p>

The country has some 2,900 confirmed cases of the virus, which is similar to smallpox but less fatal. The announcement comes a day after America declared its own monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency, following a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/07/23/monkeypox-is-declared-a-global-health-emergency">similar move</a> by the World Health Organisation.</p>

<h3>America’s labour market steams ahead</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It is still a very good time to be looking for a job in America. Just when it seemed that the labour market might be softening, the economy added 528,000 jobs in July, the most since February. America has now <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2021/07/07/labour-markets-in-the-rich-world-are-recovering-from-covid-19">fully recovered</a> all the jobs lost during the pandemic. The unemployment rate edged down to 3.5%, equaling the fifty-year low hit just before covid.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The good news for job-seekers is less welcome for investors. With the labour market so tight, private-sector wages are rising at an annual pace of more than 5%. That is far too fast for the Federal Reserve to succeed in bringing inflation back to its target of roughly 2%. If the strong jobs growth continues this month, the Fed may tee up another <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/the-federal-reserve-is-causing-pain-in-financial-markets/21809132">super-sized interest rate increase</a> at its next meeting, scheduled for September. All the monetary tightening will eventually cool the job market. Just not yet.</p>
<h3>The sultan and the tsar</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin met in Sochi this afternoon for their second summit in 17 days to talk about energy, economics and war. But top of the agenda for Turkey was Syria, where Mr Erdogan is planning a new ground war against Kurdish militias. Mr Putin opposes the plan. But his international isolation and military humiliation in Ukraine have him on the backfoot. Meanwhile his Turkish counterpart has emerged as the successful <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/01/the-first-grain-ship-leaves-odessa-under-a-un-brokered-deal">broker of a deal</a> to release Ukrainian and Russian grain exports across the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Turkey also needs Russia for its money. Mr Erdogan’s government has not joined in Western sanctions, making his country a destination for oligarchs’ superyachts and potentially also for their investments. Last week the Kremlin said it is buying $6.1bn in Turkish treasury bonds as part of a loan deal for the Russian-built Akkuyu nuclear power plant, currently under construction on the Mediterranean coast. The cash will provide a much needed boost to Turkey’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/07/21/how-has-turkeys-economy-kept-growing-despite-raging-inflation">shrinking foreign currency reserves</a>.</p>
<h3>The Edinburgh Festival struggles to stay festive</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The first Edinburgh International Festival was held in 1947 to rebuild <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2021/07/08/european-folk-festivals-reboot-as-covid-19-ebbs">cultural ties across Europe</a> following the ravages of the second world war. Since then it has prided itself on its cosmopolitanism; in 2019 2,800 artists from over 40 countries performed in classical music, theatre and dance shows.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This year’s edition, which starts on Friday, is fighting to hold up that mantle. The war in Ukraine, chaos in the airline industry and Brexit have created a perfect storm of logistical challenges. There is a shortage of temporary workers, burdensome documentation and visa requirements are holding up European artists and the cost of shipping equipment has rocketed. Many performers are worried about having to cancel at the last minute because of covid-19; audiences, duly wary, are not booking their tickets in advance, depriving shows of cash. In its 75th year, the festival is having to try harder than ever to preserve its international roots.</p>
<h3>Gold loses its lustre</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">AngloGold Ashanti, the world’s fourth-largest gold producer, wanted its results to shine on Friday, as it reports on the changes made by the chief executive appointed in July 2021. But shrinking profits left financial markets unimpressed. The company’s share price rose less than 2% and remained 58% below its all-time high in July 2020. Similarly poor returns have been registered by competitors, including America’s Newmont and Canada’s Barrick Gold. That is in part because <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2020/02/06/gold-companies-try-to-restore-their-sparkle">gold miners</a> often outperform gold in a rising market, but also sink lower when it is on the way down. The metal’s price has dropped by 14.5% since March. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Historically, bullion has been seen as a safe haven amid inflation—and the shares of its miners as a hedge. This time around, the miners are suffering from higher costs without benefiting from higher prices. Either speculators think inflation is temporary or, for now at least, gold’s historic insurance role is waning.</p>
<h3>India’s economic risks pile up</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For months, as other central banks around the world tightened monetary policy, the Reserve Bank of India held firm, wary of jeopardising a fragile economic recovery from the pandemic. In May, however, the RBI sprung into action. It increased interest rates by 0.4 percentage points, and again by 0.5 percentage points in June. The annual inflation rate, at 7% in July, has now exceeded the RBI’s upper threshold of 6% for five consecutive months. On Friday the bank announced another raise of 0.5 percentage points, which pushed rates back to pre-pandemic levels. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">It is not just inflation that the bank is worrying about. The value of the rupee fell to its lowest-ever rate against the dollar in July, forcing the RBI to draw on foreign reserves to prevent further damage. India’s trade deficit has ballooned, too. The RBI need not look far to see the cost of mismanagement. Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are already in deep economic trouble.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 BST on <strong>Friday</strong> to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cb9abea2b18eb8bbb9aeb8b8a48baea8a4a5a4a6a2b8bfe5a8a4a6e5">[email&#160;protected]</a> We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown one winner per continent on Saturday.</p>
