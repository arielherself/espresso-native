<p class="customisedFont">A Russian missile attack on Mykolaiv, a city in southern <strong>Ukraine</strong>, killed at least one civilian amid strikes across the country. Water supplies were restored in Kyiv on Tuesday, according to the city’s mayor, after Russian attacks left 80% of its residents without running water. President Vladimir Putin said the strikes on Ukrainian <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/27/europes-gas-and-electrical-grids-need-expanding">infrastructure</a> were partly retaliation for Ukraine’s drone attack on Russian ships in the Black Sea. Meanwhile <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2018/04/12/american-sanctions-and-fears-over-syria-roil-russian-markets">Oleg Tinkov</a>, a Russian oligarch, renounced his citizenship, saying he did not want to be “associated with a fascist country”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> has yet to concede defeat in<strong> Brazil’s</strong> presidential election after <strong>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva </strong>was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/31/lula-will-be-brazils-next-president-now-for-the-hard-part">declared the winner</a> on Sunday. Mr Bolsonaro, the right-wing incumbent, suggested during the campaign that vote-rigging could yield an illegitimate result, raising fears about an orderly transfer of power should he lose. Lula won with 50.9% of the vote.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Israelis</strong> headed to the polls for the fifth time since 2019. The race for control of the Knesset is neck-and-neck between right-wing parties supporting <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/27/binyamin-netanyahus-memoir-is-a-fascinating-study-of-power">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>’s return <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/israels-binyamin-netanyahu-bids-for-an-election-comeback">as prime minister</a> and centrist and left-wing parties who do not.

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong>, now the CEO of <strong>Twitter</strong>, which <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">he bought</a> for $44bn last week, dissolved the social-media company’s board—making himself its sole director. It was reported that he intends to start charging the site’s verified “blue-tick” users $20 a month. Mr Musk had already alarmed Twitterati by tweeting (then deleting) a link to a conspiracy theory about <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/30/the-attack-at-the-pelosis-home-was-part-of-a-dangerous-pattern">an attack at the home of Nancy Pelosi</a>, the Speaker of America’s House of Representatives.</p>

<h3>What Lula’s win means for Brazil</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/31/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-be-brazils-next-president">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> will lead Brazil again after winning the country’s fiercest contest since it returned to democratic elections in 1989. Mr Lula, of the leftist Workers’ Party, will return as president—he previously served two terms between 2003 and 2010—after narrowly beating the right-wing populist incumbent,<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/10/15/the-enduring-threat-of-jair-bolsonaro"> Jair Bolsonaro</a>, in Sunday’s election. Lula won 50.9% to Mr Bolsanaro’s 49.1%, a margin of just over 2m votes. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">After a campaign marked by violence and fake news, Lula must pacify a fractured country. “I will govern for 215m Brazilians, not just for those who voted for me”, he said in his victory speech. But Mr Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly cast doubt on the electoral system, may not accept defeat. Depending on his reaction <em>b</em><em>olsonaristas </em>may resort to street violence. Lula hopes to boost spending to alleviate poverty. Mr Bolsonaro’s allies in congress, though, may block <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/20/brazils-next-president-will-face-a-big-tricky-in-tray">his agenda</a>. Lula will find governing much harder this time around.</p>
<h3>Another election in Israel</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday Israel is holding its fifth parliamentary election in less than four years. Yet again, the campaigns centre around whether <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/27/binyamin-netanyahus-memoir-is-a-fascinating-study-of-power">Binyamin Netanyahu</a>, the former prime minister who was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2021/06/13/naftali-bennett-pushes-binyamin-netanyahu-out-of-power-in-israel">forced out</a> amid a myriad of scandals in 2021 and is now leader of the opposition, should <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/israels-binyamin-netanyahu-bids-for-an-election-comeback">return to office</a>. Israelis are split on the issue. Right-wing and religious parties supporting Mr Netanyahu are forecast to win 60 seats in the 120-member Knesset. The rest will go to centrist and left-wing parties opposed to his return.<br/><br/> Under Israel’s proportional-representation system, no single party has ever won an outright majority in the Knesset. A stable government is far from assured. If Mr Netanyahu’s bloc wins a majority he will be beholden to far-right ultra-nationalist parties. If Mr Netanyahu fails, the incumbent prime minister, Yair Lapid, will be stuck with a coalition of squabbling parties which last time collapsed after only a year. Yet another trip to the ballot box seems likely.</p>
<h3>The bad business models of digital darlings</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday Uber will publish its quarterly results. Despite being the largest ride-sharing company in the world, it is expected to report yet again that it spent more money than it made. And its problems are not unique. After a multi-year bull run, American technology stocks are suffering a sharp correction. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has fallen by almost 30% in the past 12 months. Crunchbase, a data provider, estimates that tech firms have shed more than 45,000 jobs this year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Some of those born after the dotcom crash of 2001 seem particularly vulnerable. They include “movers” (<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/uber-doordash-and-similar-firms-cant-defy-the-laws-of-capitalism-after-all/21806198">like Uber</a>), “streamers” (like Netflix), and “creepers” (like Snap, which make their money by serving targeted ads), which have all seen their share performances decline. These businesses, though diverse, have made similar mistakes, including an overestimation of the value of users and an underestimation of the risk of copy-cats. Despite what tech-enthusiasts once believed, the harsh laws of competitive capitalism still apply online.</p>
<h3>The Arab League meets</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“Sorry, something went wrong,” reads an apology on the homepage of the Arab League’s duff website. Many of its 22 member-states would agree. The group’s first summit for three years opens on Tuesday in Algiers, Algeria’s capital, but the leaders of most of the Gulf states, Morocco and<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/26/syrias-outcast-dictator-returns-to-the-arab-world"> Syria</a> (which was suspended in 2011) are staying away. Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, cried off, citing an earache. And<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/28/lebanon-goes-to-the-polls-amid-its-worst-ever-financial-crisis"> Lebanon</a> has no leader to send after its president stepped down on October 30th. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Unlike other regional bodies, the League has no common market or currency, and no peace-keeping force. It also has little consensus. Arab leaders disagree on<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/a-change-in-iran-could-reshape-the-middle-east"> Iran</a>, Libya, disputed<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/26/morocco-scents-victory-in-western-sahara"> Western Sahara</a> and<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/22/trade-and-security-ties-are-knitting-israel-into-its-region"> relations with Israel and Palestine</a>. To find some common ground the League’s chairman, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, has suggested a focus on food security and other issues caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. But even that leads to rancour. While energy producers celebrate booming economies caused by high prices, consumer countries are crashing into recession. More beleaguered than League, perhaps.</p>
<h3>George Balanchine’s life and art</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The life of George Balanchine, an influential ballet choreographer, was a journey across the political and cultural landscape of the 20th century. Born in St Petersburg in 1904 Balanchine came of age during an era of revolution. He fled west, first to Berlin, then Paris and eventually America. In 1934 he helped to set up the School of American Ballet and in 1948 he co-founded the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2015/04/10/something-old-something-new">New York City Ballet</a>. “Mr B”, a new biography by Jennifer Homans, is a portrait of a fascinating man and of the art to which he dedicated his career.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Homans explores both the technical details of Balanchine’s craft and the messy details of his personal life. For Balanchine, dance was inextricably bound up with love and sex. He was a difficult boss: generous, but petty and tyrannical. Ms Homans does not shy away from the darker side of his character, but is willing to forgive him for the sake of his genius.</p>
