<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russian</strong> troops retreated from <strong>Lyman</strong>, a key logistics hub in Donetsk, hours after Ukrainian forces entered the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts">city</a>. Ukraine said the recapture would allow its military to advance into Luhansk, a region Russia took over in July. The retreat comes after Vladimir Putin’s illegal annexation of four regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk and Luhank. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/16/who-is-ramzan-kadyrov-the-brutal-chechen-leader-claiming-to-be-in-ukraine">Ramzan Kadyrov</a>, the leader of Chechnya, a region in southern Russia, urged Mr Putin to take “more drastic measures”, including “the use of low-yield nuclear weapons”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The death toll from <strong>Hurricane Ian</strong> continued to rise as it moved into Virginia. At least 54 people have died so far—almost all of them in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida">Florida</a>. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are without power. President Joe Biden will visit Florida on Wednesday to survey the damage there. Ian is expected to dissipate by Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">At least 129 people were killed in a stampede after a football match in <strong>Indonesia</strong>. Supporters of Arema FC, a club from Malang, East Java, rushed onto the pitch after their team lost to regional rivals, Persebaya Surabaya. Local police retaliated with tear gas which triggered a stampede, according to the region’s police chief. Fixtures in the league have been suspended for a week.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ibrahim Traoré, an army captain who <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/01/for-the-second-time-this-year-soldiers-stage-a-coup-in-burkina-faso">staged a coup</a> in <strong>Burkina Faso</strong>, said that the ousted leader, Paul-Henri Damiba, is plotting a counter-attack. Gunfire echoed across the capital on Saturday and protesters started a fire outside the French embassy. Colonel Traoré has accused the French army of sheltering Colonel Damiba—France has denied the claims.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Exit polls from <strong>Latvia </strong>showed that New Unity, a party led by Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins, a staunch critic of Vladimir Putin, was set to win the general election by a sizeable margin. Its political rival, the Harmony party, which draws most of its support from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2018/10/11/why-russian-latvians-vote-for-their-own">Latvia&#x27;s ethnic Russian population</a>, is projected to have not won enough votes to enter parliament.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Poland </strong>began to receive gas from Norway through a new pipeline running from the Baltic Sea to Poland via Denmark. The Baltic Pipe will help <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/russia-cuts-off-gas-to-two-european-countries/21808988">diversify</a> Poland’s gas supplies away from Russia. Meanwhile, <strong>Bulgaria </strong>and <strong>Greece </strong>began operating their long-delayed gas pipeline. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called it a “game changer” and said it would deliver “freedom from dependency on Russian gas”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Demonstrators clashed with <strong>Iraqi</strong> security forces near Baghdad’s Tahrir Square on Saturday, the anniversary of anti-government protests in 2019. <strong>Protesters</strong> chanted “we want to overthrow the regime” and threw stones; security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades. At least 86 people were wounded. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/31/iraqs-political-deadlock-turns-violent">Iraq</a> is currently in political deadlock after Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shia cleric, won the most seats in elections last year, but not enough to form a government.</p>

<h3>Seeking investment, Ukraine hosts a business shindig</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The backdrop for IT Arena 2022, a business conference that ends on Saturday in Lviv, in western Ukraine, looks grim. On Friday Russia forcibly annexed a sizable chunk of the country, annual inflation is around 20%, wages have been cut and Ukraine’s economy is on track to shrink this year by nearly a third. But conditions could be worse. Earlier in the war it looked as though GDP would fall by half. Unemployment is falling, albeit from frightful heights. Hiring is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/06/30/tracking-changes-to-ukraines-economy">strongest in western areas</a> such as Lviv, where IT Arena 2022 attendees have gathered at secret venues. One is underground; the other has bomb shelters.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Aiming to make the most of Ukraine’s reputation for resourceful resistance and plucky entrepreneurialism, the government has launched Advantage Ukraine, a programme to boost foreign investment. Red tape is being cut. Hundreds of permit requirements have been scrapped. Ukraine, its economy minister says, seeks not humanitarian aid, but investment, which “we understand…as blood for the Ukrainian economy”.</p>
<h3>China’s National Day holidays</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In normal times, China’s “Golden Week” vacation, which begins on Saturday, calls forth a glut of holiday spending. But wallets are lighter this year. Sporadic lockdowns to stamp out covid-19 have worsened an <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/18/chinas-economy-is-beset-by-problems">economic slump</a>. Would-be travellers also fear getting trapped—150,000 got stuck at the beach resorts of Hainan, a southern island province, during a covid outbreak this summer. Tourist spending during last year’s holidays was just 60% of that in pre-covid times. This year could be worse.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Communist Party will try to cheer up gloomy staycationers. State media call for patriotic “positive energy” in time for a party congress later in October, at which <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/theprincepod">Xi Jinping</a> is likely to be awarded a third term as leader. A film about heroic diplomats rescuing overseas Chinese from a war zone will hit cinemas, to lift spirits. “The motherland will never leave behind any citizen,” intones one character in the film’s trailer. Officials will hope a lockdown does not close cinemas and stop people getting the patriotic message.</p>
<h3>A documentary about sisterhood in Myanmar</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When the Burmese army <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2017/09/09/a-state-led-massacre-triggers-an-exodus-of-rohingyas-from-myanmar">drove 700,000 Rohingyas</a>, a mainly Muslim ethnic minoritiy, out of Myanmar in 2017, the news that reached the rest of the country was mostly state propaganda demonising those forced into exile. Filmed between 2016 and 2021 in a Rakhine village, Snow Hnin Ei Hlaing’s documentary tells a different tale. “Midwives”, which won a prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and was released in Britain on Friday, follows Hla, a tough-talking Buddhist Rakhine midwife and Nyo Nyo, her ambitious Muslim Rohingya apprentice.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Their friendship is tested by personal quarrels, as well as by escalating conflict and racial hatred. The babies they deliver, born into the world’s largest stateless minority, face an uncertain future. But the women are united in their mission to help Rohingya mothers and other patients. The country’s Bamar ethnic majority, says Ms Snow Hlaing, found a new solidarity with persecuted minorities after a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2021/02/06/myanmars-coup-turns-the-clock-back-a-decade">bloody coup last February</a>. “The whole country became like the Rohingya.”</p>
<h3>Black rhinos may be better off hornless</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It is a sorry state of affairs when protecting a species from annihilation requires hacking off its most prominent feature. Nevertheless, that is what many African rhinoceros reserves have resorted to, to protect their charges from poachers. Dehorning rhinos is seen as the ultimate poacher-deterrent—it is the value of the horn that they are willing to kill for. And although dehorning is painless, its critics have suggested it may harm rhinos’ well-being or reproduction.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A study in the <em>European Journal of Wildlife Research</em> allays some of those fears. It looked at four subpopulations of black rhinos in Namibia, three of which had undergone dehorning. Reassuringly, in all markers of population growth (lifespan, birth rates and offspring survival) dehorned rhinos were doing just as well as horned ones. And while a hornless rhino may look somewhat diminished, it is certainly preferable to one slain by poachers.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin’s private-army supremo</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">This week <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/who-is-yevgeny-prigozhin-the-man-behind-the-wagner-group">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a> stepped out of the shadows. The close ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, admitted for the first time that he founded the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation">Wagner Group</a>, a network of guns-for-hire that does much of Russia’s dirty work. “I cleaned the old weapons myself, sorted out the bulletproof vests myself,” said Mr Prigozhin of Wagner’s early days.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The mercenaries emerged in Ukraine in 2014 to aid Russia’s annexation of Crimea and back up pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The group then expanded wherever Russia had an interest, including <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2017/11/02/how-wagner-came-to-syria">Syria</a>, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2019/12/12/foreign-powers-are-piling-into-libya">Libya</a>, the Central African Republic and Mali.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">As for Mr Prigozhin, little is known about his childhood. He spent most of his 20s in prison, serving nine years for robbery and fraud. After his release, he set up a hot-dog stand in St Petersburg in the 1990s. He soon opened chic eateries: his New Island floating restaurant was a favourite of Mr Putin, at the time deputy mayor of St Petersburg. His associations with Russia’s elite brought lucrative catering gigs for schools, hospitals and the army—and earned him the nickname “Putin’s Chef”. But it was his work outside the kitchen that earned him a reputation in the West. In 2018 American prosecutors indicted Mr Prigozhin, alleging that he financed a Russian “troll farm” to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2018/02/17/putins-chef-cooks-up-a-storm">spread online misinformation</a> during the presidential election in 2016.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Prigozhin long denied involvement in Wagner’s bloody operation, and sued journalists who suggested as much. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine the group may have helped capture several eastern cities. Mr Prigozhin is putting his name to that. He may think that Russia’s tattered relationship with the West means there is no more point in maintaining the open secret. He may also be reminding Mr Putin, amid <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces">battlefield losses</a> and a backlash against mobilisation at home, of his loyalty and value.</p>
