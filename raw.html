<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Bob Iger</strong> returned as boss of <strong>Disney</strong>, less than a year after he left the theme-park-to-superheroes behemoth. Mr Iger, who previously ran Disney from 2005 to 2020, replaces Bob Chapek, who lasted less than three years. The firm’s share price has nosedived this year as investors fret over its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591">expensive foray</a> into <strong>streaming services</strong>. That division lost $1.5bn during the past quarter. During his previous tenure, Mr Iger was credited with turning Disney into one of the world’s most <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2020/02/27/bob-iger-king-of-disneyland">formidable content-and-technology powerhouses</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Three and a half million residents in <strong>Beijing’s</strong> most populous district were asked to stay home from Monday, in a bid to contain rising covid-19 infections. China’s capital reported nearly 1,000 new cases on Monday, a day after acknowledging fatalities for the first time since May. Parts of <strong>Guangzhou</strong>, a giant southern city, were also locked down. The government recently <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/14/a-radical-shift-in-chinas-property-and-pandemic-policies">eased</a> some covid-control policies.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine </strong>came close to nuclear disaster as shells hit near reactors and radioactive waste storage facilities at the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant">Zaporizhia</a> <strong>power plant</strong> on the weekend, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for the attack on the facility, which is in Russian-controlled territory. Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on eastern Ukraine on Sunday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A shallow 5.6-magnitude <strong>earthquake </strong>hit Java, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/why-indonesia-matters">Indonesia</a>’s most populated island, on Monday, killing at least 162 people and injuring hundreds more. Dozens of buildings were reduced to rubble in the densely-populated Cianjur region, which is 75km southeast of Jakarta, the capital. People were evacuated amid a risk of landslides.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Turkey’s</strong> president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that “ground forces” could be used in an incursion into <strong>Kurdish-controlled Syria</strong> in retaliation for a deadly attack in Gaziantep, a Turkish province. Mortar shells fired from northern Syria on Monday killed two people. Cross-border tensions escalated after Turkish air raids on Kurdish militants in Syria on Sunday in response to a bomb attack in Istanbul last week.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A deal that would have bound together two of America’s biggest publishers, <strong>Simon &amp; Schuster</strong> and <strong>Penguin Random House</strong>, has just about come unglued. Bertelsmann, a German media giant and PRH’s parent, announced the plan in 2020, but earlier this month a judge blocked the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2020/11/26/bertelsmann-snaps-up-simon-and-schuster">$2.2bn merger</a> on antitrust grounds. Simon &amp; Schuster’s owner has reportedly declined to join a legal appeal to save it.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The football associations of seven European countries told their captains not to wear “OneLove” armbands, promoting sexual equality, at the <strong>World Cup</strong> in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/in-defence-of-qatars-hosting-of-the-world-cup">Qatar</a>. Players had been prepared to pay fines for doing so but FIFA, football’s governing body, threatened yellow cards. Gay sex is illegal in Qatar. The tournament opened on Sunday with a 2-0 drubbing of the host country by Ecuador.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 90%, the percentage of its revenue that FIFA makes from the World Cup. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/11/17/the-qatar-world-cup-shows-how-football-is-changing">Read the full story</a>.</p>

<h3>After COP27, hopes for climate mitigation look to Dubai</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">After the tortuous <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/11/20/a-new-un-fund-for-loss-and-damage-emerges-from-cop27">brokering of COP27</a> finally ended, Frans Timmermans, the EU’s lead negotiator, took to the floor. “Tomorrow,” he told delegates, “we start preparing for COP28.” Like many, Mr Timmermans was disappointed that the summit in Egypt did not go further to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. He also stressed the need for countries at the next conference—which will be held in Dubai in November 2023—to make a firm commitment to reduce their use of all fossil fuels. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">That might be tricky. Oil and natural gas power the economy of the United Arab Emirates, the next host. Alongside other petrostates, it fought to stop <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/17/what-is-the-fossil-fuel-industry-doing-at-cop27">fossil fuels</a> from being discussed more seriously in Sharm el-Sheikh. And although the biggest breakthrough at COP27 was the agreement to establish a “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage">loss-and-damage</a>” fund to help vulnerable countries recover after disasters, the details of how that fund might operate will now have to be agreed.</p>
<h3>Twitter’s mass unfollowing</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Soon after becoming Twitter’s owner, chief executive and only board member on October 27th, Elon Musk ordered staff to stop working from home and get back to the office. Last Thursday they received an email announcing, without explanation, that the firm’s San Francisco headquarters were closed. On Monday the office reopens. The question is how many staff will come back.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">If Mr Musk’s three weeks in charge have looked chaotic from the outside (the latest: reinstating Donald Trump’s account, following an online poll—and then Kanye West’s), internally they have been even bumpier. He sacked half the employees in his first week, and later laid off contractors moderating content. Last week he ordered remaining staff to recommit to “extremely hardcore” work, or leave. Many reportedly walked.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Twitter had been <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">overstaffed</a>, relative to peers. But the scale and speed of the exodus is destabilising. Mr Musk warned recently that Twitter could <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/11/17/alternatives-to-twitter-see-an-influx-of-users">run out of money</a>. Before that it may run out of people.</p>
<h3>The long road ahead for Evergrande</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday a plot of land in Shenzhen, a city in south China, will go up for auction. It was supposed to be the new headquarters for Evergrande. But thoughts of a shiny new office are far off for the struggling Chinese property developer. The company is months behind schedule for releasing a plan on restructuring its massive debts. The group, which has some $300bn in liabilities, has been the bellwether for China’s embattled <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/17/only-a-revived-economy-can-save-chinas-property-industry">property industry</a>. It defaulted in December, promising to produce a restructuring plan within six months. But investors remain in the dark.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Chinese government <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/14/a-radical-shift-in-chinas-property-and-pandemic-policies">recently announced</a> measures that will help distressed property firms. Bank loans for some companies that were due in the next six months can now be extended. But it is unclear how much this will help Evergrande, which is still being forced to hock assets, such as the land in Shenzhen, to avoid collapse.</p>
<h3>Kosovo and Serbia look for a deal</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Albin Kurti, Kosovo’s prime minister, and Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s president, meet in Brussels on Monday as the EU seeks to calm the latest tensions between the Balkan neighbours. The meeting comes a day before a deadline set by Kosovo for drivers in mostly ethnically Serb areas to ditch Serbia-issued licence plates, or face a fine when driving in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Kosovo, where the majority of people are ethnic Albanians, declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Although 117 countries recognise it internationally, Serbia does not. The latest spat, which has prompted Kosovo Serbs to quit some of the country’s institutions, has only increased tensions.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Even if Messrs Kurti and Vucic can cobble together a deal on number plates, more needed is an agreement on major issues such as the proposed creation of an “association” of Kosovo Serb municipalities. But that would require unpopular political risks, which neither leader is willing to take.</p>
<h3>In “Glass Onion”, Hollywood targets the mega-rich</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2019 Rian Johnson, a director, introduced viewers to the camp murder mystery of “Knives Out”, starring Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a detective extraordinaire, sniffing out a killer in a clique of entitled snobs in Massachusetts. Now Mr Johnson is back with “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery”, another mind-bendingly intricate whodunnit starring Mr Craig, this time set on a private Greek island.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Johnson’s delightfully colourful and clever comedy, which is released in America and Britain on November 23rd, is part of an intriguing trend. Two other recent releases have crass multi-millionaires getting their bloody comeuppance on small islands: “The Menu”, starring Ralph Fiennes as a vengeful celebrity chef, and “Triangle Of Sadness”, the winner of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Hollywood has tended to revere the super-rich, but now it seems that the knives are out.</p>
