<p class="customisedFont">Sergei Shoigu, <strong>Russia’s</strong> defence minister, said the <strong>“partial mobilisation”</strong> of 300,000 reservists was complete, with 82,000 already sent to Ukraine. The mobilisation, which Russia <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation">introduced in September</a>, has drawn stinging criticism. On Friday Maxim Ivanov, a member of parliament, said it was “unacceptable” that conscripts were being deployed without proper training. Hundreds of thousands of Russian men have fled the country in the past month to avoid being drafted.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s three largest <strong>stockmarket </strong>indices ended the week higher. The NASDAQ Composite gained 2.9% on Friday, buoyed by Apple’s strong earnings—a bright spot among disappointing results from the tech giants. Separately, the Federal Reserve’s preferred<strong> inflation</strong> measure rose in line with expectations in September. The personal-consumption expenditures index rose by 0.5% from August and by 5.1% from a year ago, excluding food and energy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Police arrested a hammer-wielding intruder as he assaulted the husband of <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>, the top-ranking Democrat in America’s House of Representatives, at Mr Pelosi’s San Francisco home. The suspect, who demanded “Where is Nancy?”, was charged with attempted murder. The attack comes days before the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/films/2022/10/20/american-democracy-is-under-threat"><strong>midterm elections</strong></a> and amid a grim spike in threats against lawmakers. Ms Pelosi’s 82-year-old husband, Paul, underwent surgery and is recovering from his injuries in hospital.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Tropical Storm Nalgae killed dozens in the southern <strong>Philippines</strong>, as flash floods and landslides <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/is-climate-change-making-hurricanes-worse">surprised residents overnight</a>. At least 72 are believed dead, with many still missing. The storm—the sixteenth this year to hit the string of islands—is expected to batter the country’s eastern coast this weekend. Around 5,000 people have been evacuated from flood-prone areas.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Germany’s</strong> economy unexpectedly grew by 0.3% in the third quarter of the year, despite <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/11/germany-faces-a-looming-threat-of-deindustrialisation">high energy prices</a> and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/10/28/frances-finance-minister-on-how-to-fight-inflation-and-preserve-stability">rising interest rates</a> dampening growth across Europe. <strong>France</strong> and <strong>Spain</strong> slowed to 0.2% growth in the same period. In less welcome news for Germany, consumer prices increased by 11.6% in October from last year, a steeper gain than anticipated.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong> completed his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/11/will-elon-musk-owned-twitter-end-up-as-a-deal-from-hell">on-off-on takeover</a> of <strong>Twitter</strong>, closing the deal at $44bn, and swiftly sacked the social-media platform’s CEO, Parag Agrawal. The world’s richest man is reportedly planning to play the role of CEO himself, as he does already at Tesla and SpaceX—and to lift “lifetime” bans for some users. Apparently no such decisions will be made until a so-called content moderation council convenes.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>ExxonMobil</strong> reported a record profit, of $19.7bn, up by a tenth from the previous quarter and nearly triple its haul during the same period last year. <strong>Chevron</strong> had its second-best quarter ever, reporting a profit of $11.2bn. America’s two largest oil majors are benefitting from high energy prices. Both saw record or near-record output from the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2018/10/20/the-shale-boom-has-made-america-the-worlds-top-oil-producer">Permian basin</a> in Texas.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Fact of the day: </strong>61%, the share of countries where adherence to the rule of law fell in the past year, according to the World Justice Project. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/26/the-eu-is-strengthening-democracy-in-eastern-europe">Read the full article</a>.</p>

<h3>Meta’s unhappy anniversary</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">One year ago on Friday Mark Zuckerberg changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta. Under that new banner just about <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/16/how-much-trouble-is-mark-zuckerberg-in">everything has gone wrong</a>. Earlier this year the company reported its first year-on-year drop in quarterly revenue and the first decline in users of Facebook, its social network. Investors hoped it was a blip. But on Wednesday Meta said quarterly revenue had fallen again, by 4%, and predicted it would drop in the next quarter too. In response the company’s share price plunged by nearly a quarter.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But these are mere Earthly problems. Mr Zuckerberg believes his company’s future lies in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/11/what-is-the-metaverse">metaverse</a>, an online space to work, play and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack">watch ads</a>. Meta has spent tens of billions of dollars building it. But fewer than 200,000 people reportedly use Meta’s flagship metaverse app. One day the metaverse may take off. The question is whether Meta, which has lost more than 70% of its market value this year, will still be around then.</p>
<h3>The beat of a different drum in Pakistan</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday Imran Khan begins a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2022/08/25/on-the-comeback-trail-with-imran-khan">protest march</a> of about 380km from the eastern city of Lahore to Islamabad, the capital. Pakistan’s former prime minister demands that elections, scheduled for late next year, are brought forward. Mr Khan was ousted earlier this year by a vote of no confidence. He is hoping that a show of street power will pile pressure on the government to dissolve parliament. The former cricketer-turned-politician has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/10/20/imran-khan-appears-to-be-more-popular-than-ever">gathered support</a> by spinning a fantastical tale of an American plot to oust him from office. He recently presented himself as a headline candidate in a clutch of by-elections; he won six of seven seats.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Khan’s march adds to Pakistan’s other political and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/06/02/imran-khan-is-jeopardising-pakistans-attempts-to-fix-its-economy">economic woes</a>. Massive flooding this monsoon season caused an estimated $40bn in damages. The country is battling high inflation and energy shortages, as well as seeking $27bn in debt rescheduling, much of it from China. If the government cracks down on Mr Khan’s march, more political turmoil will follow.</p>
<h3>More gushing profits for Exxon</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">ExxonMobil played down its quarterly earnings ahead of their release. But on Friday America’s largest oil firm logged $20bn in profits, nearly triple last year’s result, despite <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets">oil prices</a> falling from the dizzying heights seen after Russia invaded Ukraine. Margins were boosted by sales of pricey natural gas, especially to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/11/the-countries-most-at-risk-from-europes-energy-crunch">energy-starved Europe</a>. Now gas prices have receded but oil prices are rising again, boosted by a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut">big cut</a> to the monthly output target of OPEC+, a cartel of producers.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Exxon still has worries. Earlier in October the company left Russia empty-handed after President Vladimir Putin expropriated some of its Russian assets. And its shiny profits will set the stage for more clashes with the Biden administration over caps on fuel exports, as politicians blame the supermajors for soaring energy prices. But for the foreseeable future, energy scarcity will keep pumping the company’s coffers.</p>
<h3>Northern Ireland heads to elections, again</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Northern Ireland has had no regional government since February. Each of its two biggest parties can block the other from governing. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215">Sinn Féin</a>, which won its first election in May, wants a united Ireland. The runner-up Democratic Unionist Party wants to keep Northern Ireland British. At midnight on Friday, six months since the last election, their time to re-establish a power-sharing government ran out, with Westminster already confirming that a fresh election will be called. It will probably be held on December 15th. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Both parties are expected to consolidate their positions with voters. Whichever wins, their main contention—on the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/06/16/the-northern-ireland-protocol-enrages-some-businesses-pleases-others">Northern Ireland protocol</a> that created a new Irish Sea border with Britain after Brexit—will remain unresolved. To prevent the region from stagnating in the meantime, Westminster may give more power to civil servants, who effectively ran the country the last time the government collapsed in 2017. Then, it took three years to replace them with politicians. The lengthy backlog of untaken government decisions looks set to grow.</p>
<h3>When Harry Met Harry</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday “Bros”, one of Hollywood’s first gay romantic comedies, is released in Britain. Co-written by its star, Billy Eichner (“Parks and Recreation”), and by its director, Nicholas Stoller (“Forgetting Sarah Marshall”), the film is a sweetly old-fashioned New York rom-com in many respects. Mr Eichner plays a celebrity podcaster who doesn’t want a long-term relationship but might be persuaded by a hunky lawyer (Luke Macfarlane) he meets at a party.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The film is anxious to mark itself apart from heterosexual smash hits, making copious references to Grindr, poppers, threesomes and foursomes. It also takes some satirical swipes at “Brokeback Mountain” and other gay-themed dramas with straight casts: the numerous <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/prospero/2017/03/21/disney-has-drawn-an-outline-for-gay-characters">LGBT characters</a> in “Bros” are all played by LGBT actors. American box-office sales have so far disappointed. Mr Eichner partly blamed homophobia. But the fact is that grown-up, sincere romantic comedies are out of fashion, whatever the sexuality of their leads.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme.
