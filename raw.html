<p class="customisedFont">World leaders gathered at Westminster Abbey for the funeral of <strong>Elizabeth II</strong>. Around 500 foreign dignitaries, including <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>, attended the service in London, which draws to a close ten days of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/queen-elizabeth">national mourning</a>. Elizabeth II’s official “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/what-does-it-mean-to-lie-in-state">lying-in-state</a>”, which saw some 750,000 people shuffle past the late monarch’s coffin, concluded early on Monday morning.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, vowed there would be no “lull” after his country’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/18/where-next-for-ukraines-army">recent success</a> in regaining territory lost to <strong>Russia</strong>. He said Ukrainian forces are preparing for the “next sequence”. Over the weekend they struck several Russian military strongholds in southern Ukraine. Britain’s defence ministry estimated that Russia has lost four jet-fighters in the past ten days; Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of the defence staff, judged Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, to be “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Volkswagen</strong>, a German carmaker, said it hopes to raise €9.4bn ($9.4bn) when it <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/02/26/porsche-and-volkswagen-are-set-to-uncouple-at-last">floats</a> <strong>Porsche</strong>, the sports-car company it owns, on September 29th. The valuation, at €75bn, is lower than its initial estimates but would still make it Germany’s second-largest IPO (after Deutsche Telekom’s in 1996). Volkswagen said it will use the proceeds to finance its electric-vehicle transition.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Joe Biden </strong>told a television interviewer once again that America would defend <strong>Taiwan </strong>if it were attacked by <strong>China</strong>. Later the White House “clarified” that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/23/what-is-americas-policy-of-strategic-ambiguity-over-taiwan">its official policy</a> on Taiwan remains one of “strategic ambiguity”. China’s foreign ministry said it “deplores and firmly opposes” the comments. Mr Biden has annoyed China this way at least three times already. If the first was a flub, the fourth cannot be.</p>

<p class="customisedFont">Greenpeace and other <strong>environmental groups</strong> said they will sue the <strong>European Commission</strong> unless it revokes the “fake green” status it has awarded to gas-fired and nuclear power stations. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/01/08/the-eus-green-rules-will-do-too-little-to-tackle-climate-change">EU’s rules allow investments</a> in such plants to be categorised as climate-friendly. Last week the European Parliament had angered climate activists by preserving wood’s designation as a source of renewable energy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">At least 94 people were killed in last week’s clashes along the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2019/10/31/convoluted-borders-are-hampering-central-asian-integration">contested border</a> between <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong> and <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, according to officials from both countries. A ceasefire between the former Soviet republics was brokered on Friday, but there have been claims of shelling since. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, spoke to leaders from both countries on Sunday and called for a peaceful solution.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The entire island of <strong>Puerto Rico </strong>lost power after being hit by<strong> Hurricane Fiona</strong>, according to its governor, Pedro Pierluisi. Joe Biden allowed the immediate release of federal resources for relief efforts (which were <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2018/04/14/america-has-let-down-its-puerto-rican-citizens">botched after Hurricane Maria in 2017</a>). Meanwhile in Japan, thousands of people on Kyushu were urged to leave their homes as Typhoon Nanmadol made landfall. The storm threatens 500mm of rainfall.</p>

<h3>Republicans struggle to self-define</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/kevin-mccarthys-accidental-truthfulness/21808964">Kevin McCarthy</a>, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, is set to unveil his party’s “Commitment to America”. Consciously modelled after the “Contract with America”—a prospectus of what Republicans would do if they won the House in 1994, which helped them win back control of Congress in midterm election—Mr McCarthy’s similarly aims to pinpoint <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/08/15/republicans-are-falling-out-of-love-with-america-inc">what Republicans stand for</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the party has shown little interest in sketching a policy agenda. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, believes such documents are counterproductive, and will not weigh in. Rick Scott, a senator from Florida, has pitched a plan under which all federal legislation would expire after five years unless explicitly reauthorised. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina befuddled many last week when he pitched a nationwide abortion limit at 15 weeks—which would be stricter than in many blue states. Expect more policy incoherence.</p>
<h3>Queen Elizabeth II is laid to rest</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday, just before 11am, the coffin of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown">Queen Elizabeth II</a> was carried to Westminster Abbey, where she was crowned almost <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/films/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-iis-reign-in-numbers">70 years ago</a>. Back then, a lady-in-waiting suggested to her, just before she went into her coronation, that she must be nervous. Yes, Elizabeth replied. And added—referring to a horse that she had running in a race four days later—“I really do think Aureole will win.”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/09/08/britains-longest-serving-ruler-strengthened-the-monarchy">intervening decades</a>, it was less for her humour than her solemn devotion to duty that she would become known: she crossed the world, smiling, waving and working. She swore in her final prime minister, her fifteenth, just two days before she died. Now, people are coming to her: <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/15/why-britons-love-to-queue">thousands queued</a> to see her coffin and world leaders, including Joe Biden, converged on London to see her funeral—and the close of an Elizabethan era.</p>
<h3>The Global Fund replenishes its coffers</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/10/10/how-to-defeat-aids-malaria-and-tuberculosis">Global Fund</a>, founded in 2002 by governments and businesses with the purpose of fighting <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/08/03/do-not-let-hiv-and-aids-slide-down-the-priority-list">AIDS</a>, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/09/08/a-new-malaria-vaccine-shows-promising-results">malaria</a> and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/most-resistance-causing-mutations-in-tb-have-now-been-identified/21805727">tuberculosis</a>, holds its so-called replenishment meeting in New York on Monday. It wants to raise $18bn to spend over the next three years in order to save 20m lives. The fund’s track record suggests it would use that money wisely. Its officials claim to have prevented 50m deaths between 2002 and 2021. Last year the fund helped put 23.3m people on antiretroviral HIV drugs, treat 5.3m people for tuberculosis and distribute 133.2m mosquito nets.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But covid has proved a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/08/02/despite-setbacks-hiv-can-be-beaten">setback</a>. Key metrics for all three diseases worsened in 2020, including the percentage of people treated for TB, which fell from 69% to 57%. Deaths from the infection rose for the first time in a decade. The successful alliance of governments and the private sector will need to continue rising to the challenge.</p>
<h3>Japan’s knotty celebration of longevity</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday Japan celebrates its <em>Keiro no Hi</em> or “Respect for the Aged Day”, a public holiday. While covid has halted annual events and gatherings for a third consecutive year, Japanese still mark it by sending gifts to grandparents, a boon for e-commerce firms.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the celebration of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/02/05/japan-is-searching-for-the-secrets-to-healthy-old-age">Japan’s longevity</a> is also a reminder of the country’s deepening demographic woes. Recently published statistics show the number of people aged 65 and over in Tokyo, the capital, reached a record level this year. Across the whole of Japan their share is around 30%. In April the country <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/creating-new-adults-will-not-slow-japans-ageing">dropped its legal age for adulthood</a> from 20 to 18, creating roughly 2m “new” adults overnight.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/06/16/elderly-japanese-are-discovering-the-benefits-of-cannabis-products">Japanese seniors</a> appear increasingly ambivalent about the holiday. Many who are active and working distance themselves from the event. Some take offence to being called “old”. As much as filial piety matters in Japan, <em>Keiro no Hi</em> may need a rejuvenation.</p>
<h3>Stop the sun, refreeze the poles</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/02/27/dusting-the-upper-atmosphere-could-help-counter-climate-change">Stratospheric aerosol injections</a> may sound like a wacky way to wind back climate change. A fleet of aircraft pump fine dust into the upper atmosphere until it sheaths the entire planet, reflecting sunlight and cooling the Earth. But when limited to polar regions, which are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/03/24/parts-of-antarctica-have-been-40degc-warmer-than-their-march-average">warming at a faster pace</a> than the rest of the world, SAI begins to look less far-fetched.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A new study published in <em>Environmental Research Communications</em>, a journal, finds that SAI could be deployed to refreeze the poles. Microscopic aerosol particles would be released at latitudes of 60 degrees north and south, and drift poleward to shade the ice. This, say the modellers, would cool the Arctic and Antarctica by 2°C per year, which would slow the pace of sea-level rise. But the method also has its drawbacks: considerable extra carbon emitted by roughly 125 tanker aircraft and an estimated cost of $11bn a year.</p>
