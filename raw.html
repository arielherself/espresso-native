<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, said 4.5m of his countrymen were <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/11/01/keeping-ukraine-from-freezing-this-winter">without power</a>, as Russia continued to bomb Ukrainian <strong>energy infrastructure</strong>. Mr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of “energy terrorism”. Meanwhile, reports emerged that Russian forces were preparing to retreat from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter">Kherson</a> city to the east bank of the Dnieper river. Ukrainian officials warned that could be a trap.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Twitter </strong>temporarily shut its offices amid reports that half of the firm’s 7,500 employees will be sacked. Workers in San Francisco sued the company on Thursday, saying it failed to give sufficient notice for the layoffs. Meanwhile, more firms pulled adverts from the site, as they wait to see whether Elon Musk, Twitter’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">new boss</a>, will turn a blind eye to unsavoury posts.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Xi Jinping, <strong>China’s</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/10/23/xi-jinping-leaves-no-doubt-who-is-in-charge-of-china">president</a>, began talks with Olaf Scholz, his <strong>German</strong> counterpart, by calling for greater co-operation between the countries amid “times of change and turmoil”. Mr Scholz is the first leader from the West to visit China since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. The pair are expected to discuss trade, the war in Ukraine and climate change.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Stocks across <strong>Asia </strong>rose amid reports that China might relax its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/05/14/chinas-zero-covid-industrial-complex">stringent covid-19 rules</a> in early 2023. Rumours emerged that a former head of China’s disease prevention commission said that the border with Hong Kong could open early next year, with further reopening to follow. Hong Kong-listed stocks were up by around 6% on Friday, with those in Shanghai rising by over 2%. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Revenues plummeted at <strong>Coinbase</strong>, America’s biggest crypto-exchange, as traders shunned cryptocurrencies. The firm earned $590m in the quarter ending in September, less than half of what it raked in during the same period last year. Trading volumes fell by 27%. Cryptocurrencies have yet to recover following a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/23/three-mechanisms-for-crypto-contagion">market crash</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Protests broke out across <strong>Pakistan</strong> after Imran Khan, the former prime minister, was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/11/03/imran-khan-pakistans-ex-prime-minister-survives-an-attempt-on-his-life">shot in the leg</a> while leading a rally. Mr Khan is out of danger. He has been calling for snap elections following his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/04/16/shehbaz-sharif-is-pakistans-new-prime-minister">ousting</a> from power in April. The gunman said he acted alone, but leaders from Mr Khan’s party suspect someone linked to Shehbaz Sharif’s government may have been behind the attempted assassination. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yair Lapid,<strong> Israel’s</strong> prime minister, conceded defeat in parliamentary elections to <strong>Binyamin Netanyahu</strong>, clearing the way for Mr Netanyahu to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/02/netanyahu-seems-on-track-to-be-israels-next-prime-minister">reclaim his old job</a>. Mr Netanyahu’s religious and right-wing coalition appears to have won 64 of 120 seats in parliament. Mr Lapid’s bloc took 51; an unaffiliated Arab party claimed the rest. To form a government Mr Netanyahu will need the support of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker">Itamar Ben-Gvir’s</a> far-right religious party, which until recently was a political pariah.</p>

<h3>America’s job market comes off the boil</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">After a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/02/americas-economy-is-too-strong-for-its-own-good">sizzling run</a>, the labour market in America may finally be cooling down. Figures due out on Friday are expected to show that the economy added about 190,000 jobs in October, the fewest since the end of 2020. That would be the third straight monthly decline in job creation, a trend that may intensify as higher interest rates weigh on business activity. On November 2nd the Federal Reserve delivered yet another jumbo rate rise.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/10/27/joe-biden-attempts-the-biggest-overhaul-of-americas-economy-in-decades">President Joe Biden</a> and the Democrats would prefer to see a stronger jobs report ahead of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/mid-terms-2022">midterm elections</a> on November 8th. But for investors and the Fed itself, signs of weakness are welcome. In recent months wages have risen quickly as companies struggle to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/05/why-businesses-are-furiously-hiring-even-as-a-downturn-looms">fill vacancies</a>, adding upward pressure to inflation. The challenge for the Fed is to bring about a softening in labour demand without provoking a sharp rise in unemployment. So far it has managed that. But economic headwinds are mounting.</p>
<h3>Disunited Russia</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday Russia celebrates Unity Day, a national holiday commemorating Moscow’s liberation from Polish invaders in 1612. President Vladimir Putin traditionally lays flowers at a statue in the Red Square lionising the rebellion’s commanders. That symbolism also chimes with his rhetoric about Ukraine, where he casts the war as an unavoidable, existential battle against the West. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In truth, to invade Ukraine was a choice made by Mr Putin. On Monday he claimed that the “partial mobilisation” of troops to Ukraine was complete. But recruitment could restart at his whim. Some Russians should be more concerned than others. Studies suggest that the conscription drive <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/21/where-are-russias-newest-soldiers-coming-from">disproportionately affected</a> poorer parts of the country. Many <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/24/how-russia-is-conscripting-men-to-fight-in-ukraine">recruits</a> also come from places with large ethnic-minority populations like Dagestan, a Muslim-majority republic in the south and Buryatia, an ethnic-Mongolian region in the east. Although Mr Putin preaches national unity, not all <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/10/05/kirill-rogov-on-what-russians-really-think-of-the-war-in-ukraine">Russians</a> are treated equally.</p>
<h3>The pope’s visit to Bahrain</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday in Bahrain Pope Francis will meet a group of Islamic leaders known as the Muslim Council of Elders. His four-day trip, the first papal visit to the country, revolves around the “Bahrain Forum for Dialogue” through which the island host hopes to promote interfaith co-operation, as well as exhibit its own religious tolerance. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Unlike some of its neighbours, Bahrain has long been fairly open to non-Muslim worship. Its 80,000 Catholics, most of them migrant workers, have several churches; there are Hindu temples and a synagogue.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The state is less tolerant with its own citizens. An <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/01/22/sunnis-and-shias-in-bahrain-remain-as-far-apart-as-ever">oppressed Shia majority</a> complain of discrimination by the Sunni monarchy. They are denied some government jobs and their towns are neglected. Inequality led to a Shia uprising in 2011, which was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2011/03/17/calling-in-the-big-guns">crushed</a> with help from other Gulf states. Prominent opposition figures are still in jail or exiled. They are calling on the pope to use his visit to urge dialogue not just between religious leaders, but between Bahrainis.</p>
<h3>A climate clash for Sunak</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Britain’s King Charles will host a hastily organised bash at Buckingham Palace on Friday. The reception is a warm-up for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/COP27pod">COP27</a>, the United Nations’ climate summit, which begins in Sharm El-Sheik, in Egypt, on Sunday.<br/><br/> Alongside foreign dignitaries, such as America’s climate envoy, John Kerry, will be British politicians. That could be awkward. In her few weeks as prime minister, Liz Truss advised the new king, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/22/king-charles-versus-trussonomics">stalwart climate campaigner</a>, not to attend COP. Rishi Sunak, her successor, held this line. He also declined to go to Egypt himself, only to change his mind after widespread criticism. This is embarrassing for Mr Sunak. It exposes divergent priorities not only with the king but also with Boris Johnson, another predecessor, who gladly accepted an invitation to COP, having hosted the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2021/11/06/cop26-in-glasgow-gets-off-to-a-chaotic-start">previous summit</a>. And it raises questions about whether Mr Sunak will keep Mr Johnson’s ambitious climate promises. His appearance at COP27 will not alter the conversation. But his handling of the affair shows a poor understanding of public mood.</p>
<h3>“Weird Al” Yankovic’s irreplicable success</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">With his big glasses, moustache and accordion, Alfred Yankovic often heard that he was “weird”. Thus in 1979, when he recorded his first hit single (“My Bologna”, a parody of The Knack’s “My Sharona”), he used the nickname “Weird Al”. He has since sold over 12m albums and won five Grammy Awards including, in 2015, the best comedy album for “Mandatory Fun”.<br/><br/> Despite competition on social media, Mr Yankovic is still the king of musical comedy. He recently played a sold-out show at Carnegie Hall in New York. On Friday a biopic, “Weird: The Al Yankovic Story”, written by Mr Yankovic and starring Daniel Radcliffe, is released on Roku, a streaming service. Fittingly the film has twisted the facts of his life to spoof the Hollywood genre. Yet Mr Yankovic insists there are “nuggets of truth”, such as when his character says the key to happiness is to “be as weird as you want to be.”</p>
