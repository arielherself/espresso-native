<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Merrick Garland</strong>, America’s attorney-general, said the Department of Justice asked a judge in Florida to make public the warrant used <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm">to search</a> <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> Florida estate. Mr Garland also confirmed that he had personally approved the decision to seek the warrant, ending speculation about who authorised the raid at Mar-a-Lago. His decision follows <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations">howls of protest</a> from Republicans, who condemned the raid and promised to probe the DoJ should they regain control of Congress in November.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Seven European countries are dispatching aid to help <strong>France </strong>combat its ongoing <strong>wildfires</strong>. One “monster” conflagration near the southern city of Bordeaux continues into its third day, having destroyed 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of forest and forced thousands to evacuate. France is in the grip of a heatwave and its worst ever drought.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, called for a demilitarised zone around Ukraine’s <strong>Zaporizhia nuclear-power plant</strong>, which has been the target of frequent shelling. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, accused Russia of threatening the world by holding <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/06/16/nuclear-plants-could-become-dirty-bombs-in-ukraine-warns-serhii-plokhy">the complex</a> hostage. At a meeting of the UN Security Council on Thursday, America supported the idea of ending fighting around the plant.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Olaf Scholz</strong>, the German chancellor, promised to deliver a new <strong>financial assistance package</strong> for citizens struggling with an <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/30/can-europe-keep-the-lights-on-this-winter">energy crunch</a>. Speaking at a press conference, Mr Scholz also said he supported the idea of building a new pipeline connecting Portugal to Spain and France; diversifying gas supplies has become a key priority for a continent attempting to reduce its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter">reliance on Russian gas</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Estonia </strong>and <strong>Latvia</strong> left China’s forum for central and eastern European countries, dealing a blow to its diplomatic efforts in the region. The two Baltic countries were reportedly driven to quit by China’s declaration of its “no-limits friendship” with Russia. The forum, known as 17+1, is now down to 14+1, after Lithuania withdrew last year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> and <strong>South Korea</strong> clashed, again, over an American anti-missile system. China claims radar from the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence system (<strong>THAAD</strong>) installed on South Korean territory could be used to spy on it and wants to restrict its use. South Korea says it is necessary for defence against North Korea. In 2017 a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2017/03/23/why-china-is-wrong-to-be-furious-about-thaad">dispute</a> over the system led to a Chinese boycott of South Korean goods.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">At least 21 civilians and six police officers were killed in <strong>Sierra Leone </strong>amid huge demonstrations against the government’s failure to tackle <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/06/23/costly-food-and-energy-are-fostering-global-unrest">soaring living costs</a>. Police used tear-gas on crowds. Protesters threw stones and set tyres on fire. In one incident a police officer fired his gun into a crowd. A nationwide curfew, implemented on Wednesday, remains in place.</p>

<h3>Ukraine’s allies gather in Copenhagen</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Danish military will train Ukrainian soldiers in Britain. That announcement came ahead of a meeting of allies in Copenhagen on Thursday, hosted by the three countries. Defence ministers from 15 European countries, plus America and Canada, will discuss further military support for Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Western aid continues to bolster Ukraine’s defences. At the meeting Britain pledged to supply more multiple-rocket systems. On Monday America pledged a further $1bn in military assistance, including more ammunition for the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/13/ukraines-new-rockets-are-wreaking-havoc-on-russias-army">HIMARS rocket launchers</a> which have pounded Russian positions. The fighting in the east and south of Ukraine remains finely balanced. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The conference highlights a second aspect of Vladimir Putin’s war. By invading Ukraine, Russia wished to stop any more countries joining NATO. But Finland and Sweden are now on the cusp of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/05/15/in-applying-to-nato-finland-and-sweden-give-the-lie-to-putins-claims">membership</a>. Britain continues to play a vital role in European security, despite tensions with the EU. Mr Putin’s invasion has transformed Europe’s security architecture, just not as he would have hoped. </p>
<h3>When the Chinese chips are down</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">China’s most advanced chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), reported its second-quarter results on Thursday. Even amid signs of a slowdown in the chip market, SMIC beat analysts’ expectations, posting net income of roughly $514m and revenues of $1.9bn. <br/><br/> Computer chips are important for everything from washing machines and cars to cruise missiles and fighter jets. China has long held ambitions to build a cutting-edge chips industry. But American sanctions, begun under Donald Trump and continued by President Joe Biden, are designed to deny China access to the latest chipmaking technology. In July it emerged that SMIC had worked out how to make advanced 7-nanometre chips. Smaller components mean better chips (though the figures bear little relation to the physical characteristics of the chips themselves). That puts SMIC about half a decade behind TSMC, a Taiwanese firm, and Samsung, a Korean one.<br/><br/> The significance of SMIC’s achievement is not yet clear. It may be that only some components on the new chips have been shrunk. And without access to the latest extreme-ultraviolet lithography tools, made in the Netherlands, it is unclear how much further SMIC can push its products.</p>
<h3>An electric vehicle startup slows down</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Rivian’s promise of powerful, green electric trucks was so thrilling that nearly 50,000 people placed an order before any had been delivered. The firm became a Wall Street sensation in 2021: its valuation zoomed <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2021/09/02/an-electric-vehicle-startup-aims-for-a-stellar-valuation">above $100bn</a> in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/10/rivians-giant-listing-comes-amid-huge-losses">biggest IPO</a> of the year. But its shares have crashed by nearly two-thirds this year. Its second-quarter earnings released on Thursday beat revenue expectations, but forecast a wider loss than initially projected for the year.<br/><br/> Rivian’s problems are familiar. Supply-chain woes and high inflation are leaving the company unable to meet sky-high demand. Other electric carmaking startups, such as Arrival and Lordstown Motors, are also struggling. Despite Rivian’s impressive order book, which has 98,000 customers waiting, in the first quarter of the year just 2,553 trucks rolled off its assembly line. It chalked up a $1.6bn loss. Now it is facing a cost crunch, obliging it to lay off 6% of its workforce.</p>
<h3>Litigating golf’s civil war</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Two months ago a group of elite professional golfers <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/06/17/will-signing-stars-like-phil-mickelson-bring-success-to-liv-golf">broke away</a> from the American-run PGA Tour to compete in LIV Golf, a lucrative series of tournaments <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/06/23/saudi-arabia-still-thinks-money-can-buy-a-new-reputation">bankrolled</a> by the government of Saudi Arabia. Some of them resigned from the PGA Tour; others had their membership suspended. Before signing up to LIV nearly a dozen players had qualified to play in the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup playoffs, which begin on Thursday in Tennessee, only to be banned by the Tour. Three of them contested the ban but on Wednesday a federal judge in America upheld it.<br/><br/> On August 3rd players in LIV who remain suspended by the PGA Tour filed an antitrust lawsuit against it, accusing it of behaving monopolistically and harming their careers. The PGA Tour denies this. The antitrust case could take up to two years to resolve. In the meantime, as the two tours run in parallel, the mutual enmity will only deepen.</p>
<h3>Televising Indian matchmaking</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“Love has no off season” declared Netflix in March, as it announced a line up of eight reality-dating shows. Among them was a second season of “Indian Matchmaking”. The show, which has just been released, features Sima Taparia, a charismatic “marriage consultant” from Mumbai, who uses profiles—like those on dating apps, which she calls “biodatas”—and astrology to pair up singletons in India and its diaspora.<br/><br/> The first series, also directed by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/prospero/2020/08/12/smriti-mundhra-both-celebrates-and-questions-indian-cultural-values">Smriti Mundhra</a>, a film-maker who met Ms Taparia during her own quest for love, intrigued foreign audiences unfamiliar with Indian family values and arranged marriages. Despite complaints about its roster of wealthy, high-caste, heterosexual subjects “Indian Matchmaking” was nominated for an Emmy last year. Having succeeded with this coupling of tradition and reality television, Netflix will soon be serving up “Jewish Matchmaking”, in which a matchmaker known as a <em>shadchan</em> introduces hopefuls in America and Israel.</p>
