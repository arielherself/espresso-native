<p class="customisedFont">Somali forces said they had overrun and killed the <strong>Al-Shabab </strong>fighters laying siege to a hotel in Mogadishu. At least 12 people died when the jihdist group, which has links to al-Qaeda, attacked the Hayat hotel in the Somali capital on Friday. It was the first significant attack by al-Shabab since <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/07/19/somalias-president-wants-help-to-fight-africas-terrorist-groups">Hassan Sheikh Mohamud</a> was elected president in May. The group already controls much of the Somali countryside.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, Ukraine’s president, warned that the Kremlin might be preparing an “ugly” attack in the lead up to independence day celebrations. Ukraine <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/why-russia-has-never-accepted-ukrainian-independence">broke away</a> from the Soviet Union on August 24th 1991. Meanwhile a drone reportedly struck the headquarters of <strong>Russia’s Black Sea Fleet</strong> in Sevastopol, Crimea, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/08/11/wrecked-planes-smoulder-at-russias-saky-airbase-in-crimea">again</a> pointing towards Russia’s vulnerability far from the front line of its war. The perpetrators remain unknown.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The daughter of <strong>Alexander Dugin</strong>, a nationalist ideologue who has been described as “[Vladimir] Putin’s brain”, was killed outside Moscow by a car bomb. Since Darya Dugina was killed while driving her father’s car, it is believed that he was probably the intended target. Both father and daughter have asserted Russia’s authority over Ukraine and both of them have been sanctioned by Britain and America.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The head of Germany’s bundesbank said that the <strong>European Central Bank</strong> will need to continue raising <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/12/how-higher-interest-rates-will-squeeze-government-budgets"><strong>interest rates</strong></a>, even though Germany—and the wider euro zone—faces the prospect of a recession. Joachim Nagel told the <em>Rheinische Post</em> that high inflation would persist into next year and could reach double figures this autumn.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Greece </strong>reached the end of a period of “enhanced surveillance” by the European Union. It will now have greater freedom to implement economic policy and should become a more attractive investment proposition. Public-debt woes forced the country to turn to the euro zone and the IMF for a first bailout in 2010. The surveillance lasted for four years after it exited <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2018/08/18/greeces-eight-year-odyssey-shows-the-flaws-of-the-eu">the third such programme</a> in 2018.</p>

<p class="customisedFont">At least 16 people died in southern <strong>Turkey</strong> after a bus collided with emergency teams working at the scene of an earlier accident. The dead include bus passengers and two journalists who had stopped to help at the site, where a car had left the highway. More than 20 people were injured.</p>

<h3>Raila Odinga’s last gamble?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Raila Odinga is the nearly man of Kenyan politics. He has stood in five presidential elections, come second in four and would probably have won at least one, were it not rigged. Now 77 years old, his seemingly final shot at redemption comes on Monday, when he is expected to challenge his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/18/william-ruto-is-declared-kenyas-next-president">latest defeat</a> in the supreme court.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Odinga lost Kenya’s election of August 9th to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/16/who-is-william-ruto">William Ruto</a>, the outgoing deputy president, by just 1.6% of the vote. Given that Mr Odinga was the favoured candidate of the departing president, Uhuru Kenyatta, proving fraud might be tricky; sitting governments tend to cheat their opponents, rather than candidates they are backing. Mr Odinga may instead emphasise a split in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/11/why-kenyas-election-is-going-down-to-the-wire">electoral commission</a>. Four of its seven commissioners questioned the result, suggesting that 142,000 votes had been miscounted, potentially enough to force a run-off. But that later turned out to be a basic mathematical error, undermining their credibility. Mr Odinga might have to settle for silver again.</p>
<h3>The EU’s Russian holiday dilemma</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">European summer holidays are reaching their apogee. But a question looms over the continent’s beaches: should Russians be allowed to join them? There are currently no air links between Russia and the West, but some sun-seekers are travelling overland to places like Helsinki, or flying to a non-EU country, before transiting onwards as they please.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet a push to stop issuing visas to Russians is gaining steam. The Estonian government has banned those with Estonian-issued visas from entering the country, while this week Finland said it would curtail the number of visas issued to Russians. Fearing a bloc-wide ban, Russians are now scrambling to grab EU visas while they can.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Hawks think it unfair that Russians can live as if their country hadn’t started a war on the continent. Others, including Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, say sanctions should punish Russia’s politicians, not its people. If only because Ukrainian authorities are lobbying for a Russian visa ban, the issue will have to be hashed out by EU grandees—after the holidays, that is.</p>
<h3>The studio saving cinema</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Four of the ten highest-grossing films of the 21st century belong to the Marvel franchise. Talk to a cinephile, and they will bemoan the state of an industry dominated by superhero action-fests and uninspired reboots. Studios no longer make mid-budget movies, or so the argument goes: it’s either blockbusters or niche arthouse fare.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But one studio has bucked the trend. A24, an American firm which celebrates its tenth birthday this weekend, has had striking success championing high-quality, auteur-led projects. The formula has garnered both acclaim and fans: “Moonlight”, a coming-of-age drama, and “Minari”, about Korean immigrants in America, won Oscars, while the TV show “Euphoria” drew over 16m viewers an episode.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">It is a financially savvy model, too. A24’s success in creating popular entertainment with low budgets has attracted backers: a $225m investment this year valued the company at $2.5bn. That is a long way behind established industry players such as Disney, Paramount, or Warner Bros. But it is the young company that is making cinema interesting again.</p>
<h3>Return to Westeros</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“Game of Thrones”, which aired from 2011 to 2019, was an era-defining hit. It won more Emmy Awards than any other drama series in history, and made “swords-and-sandals” epics a priority for every network. But its rushed and somewhat illogical ending disappointed. Although the whole saga is still ranked as the 13th best series of all time on IMDb, a review site, with a 9.2 average rating, its finale scores just 4.1. Even George R.R. Martin, the author of the “Game of Thrones” books, has distanced himself from the series’ ending.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Sunday HBO will expand its franchise with the premiere of “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/08/19/house-of-the-dragon-is-a-slick-follow-up-to-game-of-thrones">House of the Dragon</a>”, the first of many planned spin-offs. Its stakes are low: watchers of “Game of Thrones” will know how the prequel unravels. But it is an expertly produced return to form, with many welcome changes—such as less emphasis on sexual violence and a more diverse cast. At least in its first season, HBO is likely to have another series adored by fans and envied by its competitors.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Fani Willis, the local prosecutor taking on Trumpworld</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“It does not matter what your notoriety is, what your fame is, if you come to Fulton County, Georgia, and you commit crimes…we are going to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.” So said Fani Willis, the local district attorney, in May, unveiling gang-related charges against Young Thug, a Grammy-winning rapper, and 27 others. (Young Thug denies the charges.) But they could equally be seen as a warning to Donald Trump—another celebrity in Ms Willis’s sights.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For months Ms Willis has been investigating attempts by Mr Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. (Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing.) Her probe—<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/08/17/merrick-garland-is-not-naive-about-political-violence">one of several</a> he faces—is sprawling. Among its targets are Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump’s former lawyer, and the Republican “fake electors” who falsely tried to certify the vote for the former president. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Charges, if and when they come, might allege a co-ordinated, criminal scheme to commit election fraud. Ms Willis has a history of using racketeering laws, which target criminal “enterprises” like the Mafia. In 2013 she used these laws to secure an indictment against teachers and administrators for inflating pupils’ exam scores, in a case that made national headlines; 11 of the 12 defendants were convicted. Her charges against Young Thug’s cohort also allege racketeering.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Willis is a formidable opponent. Described as a “street-fighter” in the courtroom, she has spent most of her career in the office she now leads. In 2020 she handily beat her former boss to win the top job. On her first day as district attorney, news broke of Mr Trump’s demand that Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s elections chief, “find 11,780 votes”. That notorious call launched a career-defining probe.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Willis maintains that she takes “no pleasure” in going after a former president. Opponents say she is on a politically motivated crusade. Last month a judge scolded her for hosting a fundraiser for the Democratic rival of a Republican whom she was investigating, and disqualified her from pursuing him.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Her inquiry is likely to last for months yet. As it gathers pace, Trumpworld may heed the words of 50 Cent, another rapper, on racketeering charges: “Those laws were designed for you not to escape them.” </p>
