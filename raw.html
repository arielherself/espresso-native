In response, Russian authorities said the bridge had been closed to civilians but remained standing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A joint co-ordination centre for Ukraine’s <strong>grain exports</strong> opened in Istanbul, Turkey. The centre is part of a deal signed by Russia and Ukraine last week to let Ukraine resume exporting grain by sea, easing a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/05/19/the-coming-food-catastrophe">global food crisis</a>.

<p class="customisedFont">The White House said that <strong>Joe Biden</strong> will speak with <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, his Chinese counterpart, on Thursday to discuss Taiwan, the war in Ukraine and economic competition between the two countries.

<p class="customisedFont">Voters in <strong>Tunisia </strong>affirmed a new constitution for their country that would roll back many of the reforms that once made it look like the Arab Spring’s sole survivor. Some 95% of voters opted for the new constitution, but less than one-third of eligible voters turned out. The opposition, which boycotted the poll, said the results were “not credible”. Kais Saied, the president, had <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/21/tunisias-president-is-pushing-an-ominous-constitution">pressed for the referendum</a> to transform the young democracy into another strongman system.</p>

<h3>The Fed tightens again</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Federal Reserve is all but certain to announce yet another hefty <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/21/the-fed-put-morphs-into-a-fed-call">interest-rate increase</a> on Wednesday as it fights to rein in inflation in America. Markets have priced in a 0.75-point rise for the second straight month, which would mark America’s sharpest monetary tightening since the early 1980s. And this will not be the Fed’s last move: most investors expect it to lift short-term rates by another full percentage point before the end of the year. That would take interest rates to more than 3%, up from, in effect, 0% at the start of March.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Fed’s belated haste to raise rates may be working. Inflation expectations—measured by consumer surveys and bond pricing—have softened slightly. But higher rates are also starting to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/24/why-it-is-too-early-to-say-the-world-economy-is-in-recession">hit the economy</a>. Construction of new houses has slowed sharply, while applications for unemployment insurance have inched up. Taming inflation without undermining growth is a tall order.</p>
<h3>Gun manufacturers under fire</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">This year in America there have so far been more than 300 <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/05/another-mass-shooting-in-america">mass shootings</a>. In 2020, young Americans were <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/05/25/guns-are-the-things-most-likely-to-kill-young-people-in-america">more likely to die from</a> guns than any other cause. Now the firearms industry is coming under scrutiny. On Wednesday a congressional committee will examine its role in America’s gun violence.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The heads of three gun manufacturers will testify, including the boss of Daniel Defense, the firm that made the rifle used by the gunman who <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/07/21/a-report-sheds-light-on-the-deadliest-school-shooting-in-texass-history">killed 19 children</a> and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas in May. On July 15th Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control lobby group, filed a complaint with regulators that accused Daniel Defense of violating the law by marketing its products to “at-risk” teens and young men.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Carolyn Maloney, the committee’s chair, has pledged to hold gunmakers accountable for the “carnage they enable and profit from”. She can point to moving testimony from another hearing, when Miah Cerrillo, an 11-year-old survivor of the Uvalde shootings, described how she covered herself in the blood of a slain classmate and played dead to save herself.</p>
<h3>Macron in Africa</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Emmanuel Macron’s three-country African tour this week marks his first trip outside Europe since his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/04/30/frances-re-elected-president-prepares-for-a-tough-second-term">re-election</a> as France’s president in April. Having visited Cameroon, on Wednesday Mr Macron travels to Benin and then to Guinea-Bissau. The trip is designed to reinforce the “renewal” of French ties to Africa, and to discuss food security and counter-terrorism in the region.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The latter is particularly pressing, given the spillover of jihadist violence from the Sahel to countries along the Gulf of Guinea. By late summer France will have ended its formerly 2,400-strong <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/14/what-have-french-forces-achieved-in-the-sahel">counter-terrorism operations</a>, and closed all its military bases, in Mali. Relations with the country’s military junta have soured amid anti-French protests. But French troops will remain in the broader Sahel region. Mr Macron hopes to continue to support counter-terrorist operations with other countries, but in ways that are less visible—leaving France less exposed to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/06/03/france-tries-to-reset-policy-in-africa">anti-colonial criticism</a>.</p>
<h3>The sputtering recovery of India’s car sector</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors, India’s two biggest carmakers, announced earnings for the quarter ending in June. Profits at Maruti Suzuki, the market leader in passenger vehicles, have more than doubled—but only when compared with last year’s covid-induced slump. Tata Motors, meanwhile, posted a loss because of rising costs and an industry-wide semiconductor shortage.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Their mixed results reflect the country’s broader <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/05/13/the-indian-economy-is-being-rewired-the-opportunity-is-immense">economic performance</a>. According to an industry body, the car sector accounts for roughly 7% of India’s GDP and nearly half of its manufacturing output; directly and indirectly, it employs around 37m people, roughly the population of Poland. And car sales are a strong indicator of consumer demand.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Overall car sales in India have grown beyond pre-pandemic levels, thanks in part to a boom in high-end SUVs. But the sales of motorbikes and other two-wheelers, the vehicle of choice for poorer Indians, have yet to bounce back. That suggests a lopsided recovery. </p>
<h3>California is burning—again</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The mercifully slow start to California’s<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/07/08/what-to-read-to-understand-the-burning-of-the-american-west"> wildfire season</a> was shattered on Friday when the so-called Oak fire set Mariposa county, near Yosemite national park, ablaze. By Tuesday morning the conflagration spanned over 18,000 acres (about 7,300 hectares) and was 26% contained. It is much smaller than the Dixie fire, which scorched nearly 1m acres last year, but is nonetheless California’s largest fire this year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">California’s wildfires matter beyond the areas they blacken. Flames threaten ancient sequoia trees, which are among the world’s most effective at carbon sequestration. America’s National Park Service estimates that wildfires have killed 13-19% of the world’s large sequoias in the past two years. Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which was dealt<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/07/21/american-climate-policy-is-in-tatters"> a fatal blow</a> last week, had devoted $27bn to the restoration of forests. Sequoias may be soldiers in the war against climate change, but with legislation stalled in Congress, they are left to fight without reinforcement.</p>
