<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia </strong>stepped up its assault on <strong>eastern</strong> <strong>Ukraine</strong> ahead of the first anniversary of its invasion on February 24th. Volodomyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said the situation in the east had “become tougher” as Russian forces advanced near the city of Bakhmut. However Ukrainian troops there are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2023/02/01/ukraines-troops-in-the-east-are-quietly-confident">quietly confident</a> of holding their enemy off. Russia wants to make gains before <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/25/what-makes-germanys-leopard-2-tank-the-best-fit-for-ukraine">tanks and weapons from the West</a> arrive in Ukraine. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/01/rallying-markets-suffer-from-a-doveish-illusion">raised its benchmark interest rate</a> by one-quarter of a percentage point, to a range between 4.5% and 4.75%, following <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">six consecutive</a> larger increases. Jerome Powell, chair of the central bank, promised “a couple more” rate increases and warned not to expect rate cuts this year. The Fed is keen to impress upon investors that it will do whatever it takes to squelch inflation.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The share price of <strong>Adani Group </strong>continued to fall during early trading on Thursday, after plunging 28% on Wednesday. The turmoil came after the firm <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2023/02/01/what-next-for-gautam-adanis-embattled-empire">called off</a> a fully subscribed sale of $2.5bn-worth of shares in Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship firm, to “insulate” investors from losses. The conglomerate has been fighting the market since Hindenburg Research, a short-seller, called it a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2023/01/31/nagging-questions-over-the-adani-empire-wont-go-away">giant con</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> gained access to four military bases in the <strong>Philippines</strong>, signing a deal that will allow it to better monitor China’s aggression in the region. The Philippines—where until now America had only limited access to bases—borders the South China Sea (which China mostly claims) and Taiwan (which it fully does). China’s neighbours are increasingly <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2023/02/01/chinas-put-upon-maritime-neighbours-are-pushing-back">pushing back</a> on such expansionism. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Meta’s</strong> share price rocketed by almost a fifth in post-session trading after it reported quarterly revenues of $32.2bn, down by 4% year over year but above forecasts. The social-media firm also said it would buy back $40bn-worth of its shares. Earlier a judge in California reportedly ruled that Meta can proceed with its acquisition of Within Unlimited, a virtual-reality firm. The <strong>Federal Trade Commission </strong>had requested an injunction to block the deal.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Rivian</strong> said it would lay off 6% of its staff of 14,000 amid a coming electric-vehicle price war. Tesla and Ford recently announced price cuts for their electric cars. Rivian, which makes electric trucks, lost $5bn in the first nine months of last year. Its share price has plunged by 90% since a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/10/rivians-giant-listing-comes-amid-huge-losses">wildly successful flotation</a> in 2021.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Australia’s</strong> central bank said that <strong>King Charles III</strong> would not feature on the country’s new five-dollar note. The British monarch—who is also Australia’s head of state—has traditionally appeared on the currency. A motif honouring aboriginal culture will take the king’s place. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era">death</a> of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022 rekindled a debate on whether Australia should <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/09/09/some-of-the-new-kings-realms-may-become-republics">become a republic</a>. </p>

<h3>Downshift, not dovish shift, for the Fed</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Federal Reserve is reducing the intensity of its monetary tightening. On Wednesday it raised interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point. That is smaller than its last increase, a half-point <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">in December</a>, which itself was a step down after a series of three-quarter-point <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done">increases</a>. The shift to smaller increments reflects the fact that, with rates now high enough to restrict economic activity, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2023/01/26/the-world-economys-inflation-problem-is-easing">inflation</a> has started to decelerate.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s central bank has a tricky task. Many investors think it is moving away from hawkishness, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/12/20/the-year-of-the-rate-shock">perhaps</a> opening the door to rate cuts before the year’s end. That has helped cause a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/24/how-the-world-economy-could-avoid-recession">rebound</a> in stock and bond prices over the past month. But the Fed worries that excessive rallies could undo its work to tame inflation. So Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, may deliver a stern message to try to rein in the bulls before they charge too far ahead.</p>
<h3>Investigating covid jobless claims</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">During the pandemic American states paid out billions of dollars in covid relief, including $794bn in hastily arranged aid schemes to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/01/31/americas-covid-job-saving-programme-gave-most-of-its-cash-to-the-rich">unemployed workers</a>. But fraud was rife. Scammers claimed benefits using stolen social-security numbers, taking the details of prisoners and even the dead. On Wednesday the House Oversight Committee will hold a hearing to investigate <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/30/vast-sums-of-money-have-gone-missing-from-pandemic-stimulus-programmes">fraudulent claims</a>—which by some estimates could total as much as $400bn<em>.</em><br/><br/> With the Republicans now in control of the House, the Oversight Committee has new ambitions.<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/09/27/what-would-republicans-do-with-a-house-majority"> James Comer</a>, the new chair of the committee, wants to use it as a platform to scrutinise President Joe Biden and his administration more widely. Mr Biden’s family’s business dealings, migrants at the southern border and America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan are all on the table. Benefit fraud, the focus of this hearing, will be hard to pin on Mr Biden, however. The aid program was established during Donald Trump’s term and only extended by Mr Biden a year later.</p>
<h3>India’s budget-balancing act</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday India’s government presented its budget for the coming fiscal year. Nirmala Sitharaman, the finance minister, announced plans to ramp up capital spending by 33% to “kickstart a virtuous cycle of investment and job creation”. That will be needed. Unemployment is rising and a global economic slowdown risks tempering <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-indian-economy-remains-a-bright-spot-in-south-asia">India’s growth</a>. Tax breaks were announced for middle-income earners, perhaps with an eye on upcoming elections. Nine states head to the polls in 2023 and this was the last full budget before a general election in 2024.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">With inflation close to the central bank’s upper limit of 6% and government debt rising, the budget includes some belt-tightening. Spending on social-welfare schemes were cut. Ms Sitharaman also promised to lower the government’s fiscal deficit to 5.9% of GDP. That would be an improvement over the 6.4% in this fiscal year, but still well above the long-term target of 3%.</p>
<h3>Myanmar’s state of emergency</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2015 and 2020 Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won democratic elections in Myanmar and led the first civilian governments in decades. But Wednesday marks two years since the army took back power <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2023/01/31/myanmars-civil-war-has-moved-to-its-heartlands">in a coup</a> and shattered the country’s young democracy, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2021/12/11/myanmars-generals-want-aung-san-suu-kyi-locked-up-forever">locking Ms Suu Kyi up</a> for good measure.<br/><br/> It is also decision time for the army, which looks set to extend the state of emergency that it declared on the day of the coup. That keeps power in the hands of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2023/01/12/myanmars-generals-are-deeply-superstitious">General Min Aung Hlaing</a>, who is also the prime minister, and who has failed to quell an anti-coup uprising that is becoming enmeshed in the country’s old ethnic conflicts.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Speculation abounds nevertheless that the regime will try to hold sham elections this year and begin a showy transition to a veneer of civilian government. The UN warns that a vote during the civil war would “fuel greater violence” as resistance fighters try to derail the polls. Peace has rarely felt so remote.</p>
<h3>“One Woman Show” goes down under</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Liz Kingsman’s rise has been impressive. “One Woman Show”, written and performed by the Australian-British comedian, launched in a 50-seat venue just before the pandemic closed theatres in 2020. In 2022 it moved to London’s West End. On Wednesday it began a run at Sydney Opera House.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The one-woman show, in which a performer plays several characters, has a place in entertainment history. The form launched such comedians as Whoopi Goldberg. Ms Kingsman’s “One Woman Show” is a hilarious deconstruction of the genre. It parodies a trend, inspired by Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s “Fleabag”, in which a young female protagonist narrates her fashionably out-of-control life.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">“One Woman Show” lampoons the vogue for revealing the personal. “It’s almost as if the more explicit this is, the braver I am,” explains Ms Kingsman’s on-stage alter-ego. It mocks, too, the way confessional comedy can lead to personal success. That her parody has brought her fame is, the real-life Ms Kingsman admits, “deeply ironic”.</p>
