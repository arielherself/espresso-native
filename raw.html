<p class="customisedFont">The S&amp;P 500 index increased 9.1% in July as <strong>stockmarkets</strong> rebounded Friday, its best monthly performance since November of 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also posted monthly rises of 6.7% and 12%, respectively. Despite fears of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/24/why-it-is-too-early-to-say-the-world-economy-is-in-recession">a recession</a>, markets were buoyed by the tech giants’ gains after Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet reported earnings this week.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>Russia </strong>blamed each other for the shelling of a prison which killed 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war. Ukraine said Russia had launched the attack to cover up evidence of Russian war crimes against imprisoned Ukrainians, and that claims to the contrary were part of Moscow’s “information war”. Russia said Ukraine had used American-supplied rockets against the prison, which is located in a Russian-controlled separatist region of Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The top diplomats from <strong>America</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong> discussed the potential for a prisoner swap and safe passage for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/22/after-agreeing-to-let-ukraine-export-grain-russia-rockets-its-port">Ukrainian grain</a> in their first call since the invasion began. Antony Blinken said he pressed Sergei Lavrov to release Brittney Griner, a women’s basketball star, and Paul Whelan, a former marine. The Kremlin would prefer to negotiate prisoner exchanges using “quiet diplomacy”, according to a statement from Russia’s foreign ministry.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Securities and Exchange Commission added <strong>Alibaba</strong>, a Chinese e-commerce giant, to its list of firms that could be jettisoned from American stock exchanges. Alibaba’s share price fell at the news. China has refused to allow American inspectors to review audits of its listed companies. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/04/09/chinas-regulators-warm-to-american-listings">The row</a> has prompted Chinese firms, including Alibaba, to seek primary listings in Hong Kong instead of New York.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Inflation</strong> in the euro zone rose to a record high 8.9%, stoked by the economic fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The new numbers may spur the European Central Bank to hike interest rates again; last week the bank raised rates for the first time since 2011. Europe’s biggest economy, Germany, reported stagnant <strong>GDP</strong> figures for the second quarter of 2022; it is set to be the worst economic performer among G7 nations this year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Belarus </strong>recalled its ambassador to <strong>Britain</strong>, accusing the British government of “hostile and unfriendly” actions. Belarus’s foreign ministry said Britain had executed policies “systematically aimed at causing maximum damage to Belarusian citizens and legal entities”, such as sanctions on Belarusian companies. Relations have soured after Belarus’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/25/why-belarus-is-called-europes-last-dictatorship">dictatorial</a> ruler, Alexander Lukashenko, cracked down on opposition and cosied up to Russia.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">President Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for the state of <strong>Kentucky</strong>, where flash floods killed at least 16 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Andy Beshear, the state’s governor, said the death toll would probably “get a lot higher”. Torrential rains battered towns this week across several states, including Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<h3>Ukraine’s grain sets sail</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A ship packed with Ukrainian grain is is readying to leave Odessa or a nearby Ukrainian port, perhaps as early as Friday. It would be the first to leave the port under an agreement brokered last week by António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The deal has survived despite a Russian <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/22/after-agreeing-to-let-ukraine-export-grain-russia-rockets-its-port">missile strike</a> on Odessa’s port on July 23rd, one day after it was signed. A co-ordination centre in Istanbul, staffed by officials from Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and the UN, will inspect ships entering and leaving Ukrainian ports to ensure they do not carry weapons. Ukraine may have to clear some of the mines it planted in its own waters, to prevent an amphibious invasion, to create corridors for cargo ships.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The deal may ease a global <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/05/19/the-coming-food-catastrophe">food crisis</a> intensified by the grain blockade. But uncertainty abounds. The costs of insuring shipments through the Black Sea have spiked, as companies fret about Russian attacks. And Russia could still—literally—torpedo the deal.</p>
<h3>America revs up its industrial policy</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The CHIPS and Science Act, a bill aimed at building up America’s technological muscle, bringing chip manufacturing back to the country and countering China, has had a tortuous path. A version was first proposed in 2020. But this week, it finally sailed through votes in the Senate and the House. On Friday President Joe Biden is expected to sign it into law.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/07/10/after-a-turbocharged-boom-are-chipmakers-in-for-a-supersize-bust">The bill</a> allocates about $52bn to the semiconductor industry, providing subsidies to manufacture chips in America. A separate $200bn will go towards scientific research, particularly in cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There are plenty of sceptics about the potential impact. America’s advantage in the semiconductor industry lies in design, not manufacturing, but the legislation is focused on the latter. Managing such a huge infusion of cash into the sciences will also be a challenge. But given America’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/10/05/is-political-polarisation-in-america-really-rising">political polarisation</a>, Congress’s ability to agree on such a big initiative is remarkable in itself.</p>
<h3>Rocketing profits at ExxonMobil</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">ExxonMobil, an American oil firm, is expected to unveil its best quarterly financial results in at least 25 years on Friday. Its profits for the second quarter could shoot up to $18bn, more than double the figure it posted in the previous three months. Two factors are boosting the company’s fortunes. First, Russia’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/ukraine-crisis">war in Ukraine</a> has led to a crunch in refined products like petrol and diesel. That has increased ExxonMobil’s refining margins by as much as $4.6bn. Second, higher global oil and gas prices will increase profits by up to $3.3bn.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But there might be trouble ahead. Sky-high profits for energy firms have triggered a political backlash: more governments may follow Britain’s lead in imposing <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/03/19/windfall-taxes-on-energy-companies-are-a-bad-idea">windfall taxes</a>. And elevated prices could eventually reduce demand, for example by spurring faster adoption of electric vehicles. As industry veterans say, the best cure for high prices is high prices.</p>
<h3>Airbnb checks out of China</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Few foreign internet services work in China. The country has its own array of super-app businesses and the government has restricted much of the competition, blocking foreign social-media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. But Airbnb, an accommodation-rental site, thought it could crack the market when it launched in 2016.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For a while it did, quickly picking up users by offering localised services on Chinese platforms. Yet revenues from China remained minuscule, accounting for about 1% of business in recent years. The Silicon Valley-based company was also occasionally rocked by controversy when minority groups, such as Uyghurs, were blocked from renting rooms. It finally called it quits in May, prompted by the government’s “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/05/14/chinas-zero-covid-industrial-complex">zero-covid</a>” policy, which has virtually halted foreign tourism. Friday is the last day users can book stays in China: from Saturday onwards they will be unable to. Airbnb joins a growing Western exodus. LinkedIn, a professional networking group, and Kindle, Amazon’s e-book service, have also ditched China over the past year.</p>
<h3>Improving HIV prevention</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For years, abstinence and condoms were the only ways to prevent HIV infections. A daily pill of tenofovir and emtricitabine was later approved for high-risk people; it prevents people from contracting HIV, even if exposed. But last year American regulators approved a new regimen: injections of cabotegravir every two months. In trials in Africa, the drug was 89% more effective at preventing acquisition of the disease than the daily pill among women at high risk. Ahead of the International AIDS Conference, which begins in Montreal on Friday, the World Health Organisation has released new guidelines recommending cabotegravir.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Treatment, too, has improved. For years, people with HIV/AIDS had to take several pills a day to stay healthy and reduce the chances of transmission. In December European authorities approved the use of infrequent cabotegravir and rilpivirine injections as a treatment; the injections are as effective as pills in suppressing viral loads but much less burdensome. For people affected by HIV, science has delivered some relief.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 BST on <strong>Friday</strong> to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@economist.com"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4415312d3e013734362137372b0421272b2a2b292d37306a272b29">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown one winner per continent on Saturday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Friday:</strong> What was the codename of the Apollo 11 lunar module?</p>
