<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> announced a plan to end mandatory quarantine for inbound travellers, beginning on January 8th, as part of an official downgrade of its level of response to the covid-19 pandemic. China’s president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, earlier said that more targeted “patriotic health campaigns” are needed during the latest phase. The country’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/12/15/our-model-shows-that-chinas-covid-death-toll-could-be-massive">hospitals</a> are reportedly becoming overwhelmed after the ending of many restrictions. <strong>Japan</strong> announced that from December 30th it will require a negative covid test for all visitors from mainland China due to the rapid spread of the virus there. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s</strong> Supreme Court blocked the cancellation of a public-health measure that has been used to quickly expel people crossing into the country from Mexico.

Title 42 will remain in place at least until February.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Taiwan</strong> announced that compulsory military service will be extended from four months to a year due to the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/will-taiwan-be-the-ukraine-of-asia">rising threat</a> from <strong>China</strong>. Conscripts will also undergo more advanced training. President Tsai Ing-wen said that current military plans are insufficient to deter China, which claims the self-governing island as its own territory. The new plan will come into effect in January 2024.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Sergei Lavrov, <strong>Russia’s</strong> foreign minister, told <strong>Ukraine</strong> to submit to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/12/23/making-sense-of-vladimir-putins-war">the Kremlin’s demands</a> or the “issue will be decided by the Russian army”. Mr Lavrov said Ukraine must surrender territory currently occupied by Russian forces. His ultimatum came a day after Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, said he was ready to negotiate peace. Earlier a Ukrainian drone attacked an airbase deep within Russia, reportedly killing three people.</p>

The long-expected retaliatory measure will last for five months, starting on February 1st. It targets G7 countries, the EU and Australia, which all agreed to set a price cap of $60 per barrel to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<h3>2023 in preview: Trump and Biden both want to run again</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping the Americas?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">America is about to witness an exciting new political era—or a bludgeoning grudge match that almost nobody wants. Which it will be will depend on what happens to Donald Trump. Will he prevail over Republican primary opponents to meet Joe Biden in a rematch in 2024? Or will younger rivals defeat one or both of the ageing antagonists to secure their party’s presidential nomination? </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Trump’s narcissism remains the black hole around which American politics revolves, but <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/11/17/ron-desantis-may-be-republicans-best-chance-to-prevent-donald-trumps-return">Ron DeSantis</a>, Florida’s governor, has emerged as a Republican powerhouse. His counterpart in Virginia, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/11/17/glenn-youngkin-is-a-kinder-gentler-trumpist">Glenn Youngkin</a>, and Mike Pence, the former vice-president, are also attracting attention. Mr Biden, meanwhile, will probably announce a bid for re-election, despite his age and low approval ratings. Democratic governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer could still mount a challenge and, if Mr Biden is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/11/10/joe-biden-should-not-seek-re-election">wise enough to step back</a>, administration officials, like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, will compete. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Americans fear for the health of their democracy, but if each party has a new generation of leaders jockeying for position, voters could see an inspiring demonstration of its vitality.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><br/></p>
<h3>2023 in preview: America’s economy is set for a downturn, not a crisis</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping the Americas?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">Start with the bad news: America is heading for a recession. Over the past half-century, whenever inflation has reached an annual rate of more than 5%, a downturn has been needed to suppress it. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/why-american-unemployment-needs-to-rise">unemployment</a> is exceptionally low, which means that the coming recession could be relatively mild. And the picture for the economy will change markedly over the year. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">Disinflation</a> will eventually take hold. By the end of 2023 talk will turn to when the Federal Reserve might start cutting interest rates.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Meanwhile, the government will have its hands full implementing the giant investment programmes signed into law in recent months—for semiconductors, electric vehicles, renewable energy and more. This is a bold plunge into industrial policy. The Biden administration is already running into trouble as allies from Europe to Asia accuse it of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/12/01/americas-asian-allies-dislike-its-tech-war-on-china">protectionism</a>. It will have an even harder time hitting its targets without squandering billions of dollars.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: An end to the war on drugs in Latin America?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping the Americas?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">The relationship between Latin America and the superpower to the north has never been easy. In 2023, as recently elected leftist leaders begin to implement their policies, tensions could mount over perennial questions of security and migration, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/is-it-the-end-of-the-war-on-drugs-in-latin-america">especially</a> over the “war on drugs”, launched by President Richard Nixon in 1971. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ideas about liberalising cocaine are gaining traction in Colombia. The country’s first leftist president, Gustavo Petro, has advocated negotiating with gangs, protecting poor farmers who plant coca and regulating cocaine consumption for medical use. Even a small experiment in decriminalising the drug’s production there could have huge implications for America’s “prohibition model”. Colombia<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/10/13/booming-cocaine-production-suggests-the-war-on-drugs-has-failed"> produces 60%</a> of the world’s supply of cocaine, and North America is the largest consumer. The Mexican government, meanwhile, has made it hard for the US Drug Enforcement Administration to operate, according to a former American official. Five decades after Nixon launched his war, Latin America is listening to its northern neighbour less than ever.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: Lula’s return will be difficult</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping the Americas?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">After four disastrous years under Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil will have a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/lulas-second-term-as-brazils-president-will-be-difficult">new president</a> in 2023: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist who held the job between 2003 and 2010. Lula wants to fight climate change, restore legitimacy to Brazil’s embattled institutions and pursue left-wing economic and social agendas.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But he faces a polarised population and a tough economy. <em>Bolsonarismo</em> will remain a powerful force, probably far beyond 2023. To carry out his plans to help the poor Lula must secure the support of Congress, which means doling out pork and patronage. At the same time he must assure markets that he is not planning a spending spree. Otherwise, interest rates will shoot up and the currency will suffer. To decrease deforestation rates, he needs to restore federal protection agencies decimated by Mr Bolsonaro. He must also secure more investment from international funders to transform Brazil’s “green economy” from a dream into reality.</p>
