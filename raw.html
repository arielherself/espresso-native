The lawsuit, filed by the oil major’s Dutch and German subsidiaries on Wednesday, argues that the Council of the EU does not have the legal authority to impose the tax—which is aimed at the extra profits fossil-fuel firms are enjoying because of high energy prices—because it is normally a power of sovereign countries.</p>

<h3>2023 in preview: Will Taiwan be the Ukraine of Asia?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 1949, at the end of China’s civil war, the defeated Nationalist regime was chased to Taiwan by Mao Zedong’s Communists. Since then every leader of the Communist Party has vowed to unify Taiwan with mainland China, but none as strongly as Xi Jinping, China’s current president. Some American generals think that China will invade in the next decade, perhaps within the next few years. In 2022 tensions flared when Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, travelled to the self-governing island. President Joe Biden has promised to come to Taiwan’s aid in the event of an attack. In a further effort to deter a Chinese attack, on December 27th Taiwan announced it will extend its compulsory military service from four months to a year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/will-taiwan-be-the-ukraine-of-asia">war in Ukraine</a> may affect the calculus on all sides. America hopes the conflict will convince Taiwan to show greater willingness to defend itself. Russia’s struggles in Ukraine will give China’s leaders pause. If an invasion of Taiwan turned into a similar quagmire it would have disastrous consequences for the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: Asian housing markets are looking precarious</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">In the capital cities of South Korea and Taiwan, average house prices are now 19 times and 16 times local incomes respectively. Those levels are even higher than the most expensive in the West. But the forces that drove housing booms in East Asia—rock-bottom global interest rates and strong Chinese growth—are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/asian-housing-markets-are-looking-precarious">rapidly abating</a>. As in America, inflation is rising, along with interest rates.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There are other threats, too. Surging energy prices have eliminated the previously healthy current-account surpluses in South Korea and Taiwan. Deficits now make those countries more dependent on flows of international capital, which are fickle. Capital flight can cause property prices to plunge.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Japan provides a worrying example. In 1989-90 property prices began to slump. That drove frugality by corporations and consumers, which all but halted Japan’s economic growth. The similarities that are emerging among Japan’s neighbours should be a source of apprehension.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: Has China reached the peak of its powers?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">At the Communist Party’s five-yearly congress in October, Xi Jinping secured a third term as party chief. He also warned the 2,300 delegates in Beijing to be ready to withstand “dangerous storms” ahead.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">China is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/has-china-reached-the-peak-of-its-powers">weaker than it might otherwise be</a>, thanks to Mr Xi. For example, he failed to prepare the public to live with covid-19 by stockpiling drugs and more widely administering vaccines and booster shots. Yet this month <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/12/06/china-is-dismantling-its-zero-covid-machine">he ditched</a> most covid controls, leading to a wave of sickness that risks overwhelming the health system.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The sagging economy and demographic challenges also worry the party. For years the share of old people has been rising, while the workforce contracts. Some think that all this means China is at the peak of its powers. A slower-growing China will have fewer resources with which to challenge the West. But a weak China could be more dangerous. If it still wants to reshape the world—or seize Taiwan—some observers fear that China will act soon, while it can.</p>
<h3>2023 in preview: India will become the world’s most populous country</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2023 (on or around April 14th, guesses the UN) India will seize China’s crown as the<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/india-will-become-the-worlds-most-populous-country-in-2023"> world’s most populous country</a>. The crown itself has little value, but it is a signal of things that matter. China’s population is poised for a steep decline; India’s will continue to grow for decades. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The growth in India’s working-age population should help its economy narrow the gap with China’s, which is six times larger. But to get the full benefit of its demographic advantage India will have to boost the productivity of its youthful people. Less than half of adult Indians are in the workforce, compared with two-thirds in China. Chinese aged 25 and older have on average 1.5 years more schooling than Indians of the same age. China is not about to fade into insignificance. But it will have to contend with India as an emerging superpower on its doorstep. </p>
