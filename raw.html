<p class="customisedFont">Police in <strong>Russia</strong> arrested more than 1,300 people for participating in protests in response to President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of “<strong>partial mobilisation</strong>”, according to OVD-Info, a Russian human-rights group. Around 300,000 <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation">reservists</a> will be conscripted under the plan, said Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister. On Wednesday seats on flights departing Russia sold rapidly and internet searches for “how to leave Russia” rocketed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> raised its benchmark <strong>interest rate </strong>by 0.75 percentage points for the third time in a row. In an effort to tame <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/14/to-fix-americas-inflation-problem-the-federal-reserve-must-go-big">stubbornly high inflation</a> the central bank has raised short-term interest rates from 0% in early March to 3% today, the sharpest tightening of monetary policy in four decades. Asian stockmarkets sank in response on Thursday. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Protesters in Iran</strong> set fire to police stations and vehicles amid ongoing demonstrations over the death of <strong>Mahsa Amini</strong>, a young Kurdish woman, in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/03/08/why-iranian-women-are-taking-off-their-veils">police custody</a>. Though fiercest in Iran’s Kurdish region, the protests have also spread to Tehran, the capital, and to some 50 cities and towns across the country. At least seven deaths have been reported.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Britain</strong> lifted a moratorium on <strong>fracking </strong>for shale gas. The controversial practice, banned in 2019 for fear of causing earth tremors in the process, was allowed to resume in an attempt to expand domestic <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/britains-energy-strategy-is-both-timid-and-unrealistic/21808702">energy production</a>.

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Japan’s government </strong>intervened in the foreign exchange market to prop up the weakening <strong>yen</strong>, its first such intervention since 1998. The yen’s value had fallen to 145 to the dollar early on Thursday (from 144 the day before) in response to the Bank of Japan’s decision to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/23/the-bank-of-japan-v-the-markets">keep interest rates low</a>. The authorities’ decision to stem that fall boosted the yen’s value back to 142 to the dollar.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In a recorded address to the UN General Assembly in New York <strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, Ukraine’s president, demanded “just punishment” for Russia, including stripping it of its veto power in the Security Council.

<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine announced that Russia had released 215 Ukrainians in an unexpected <strong>prisoner swap</strong>, including commanders of its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/05/17/mariupols-last-ukrainian-defenders-begin-to-surrender">Azov battalion</a>. The Ukrainian side released 55 Russian fighters and Viktor Medvedchuk, an oligarch close to Mr Putin. Russia also released ten third-country prisoners of war, including five British nationals, after negotiations mediated by Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2022/07/28/mbs-despot-in-the-desert">Muhammad bin Salman</a>. </p>

<h3>Iranians rage over a young woman’s death</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Iran has seen almost a week of protests since the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman whose “crime” was her clothing. Ms Amini was detained in Tehran by the morality police earlier this month, supposedly for wearing a loose <em>hijab</em>, a headscarf in her case. Police claim she suffered a heart attack. But witnesses say she was badly beaten. Her death set off demonstrations across the country. Some women have burned their headscarves. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Compulsory wearing of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/03/08/why-iranian-women-are-taking-off-their-veils"><em>hijab</em></a> is a pillar of Iran’s theocratic regime. Relax the dress code, religious leaders’ thinking goes, and unwanted ideas may follow. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/08/02/what-an-attack-on-an-oil-tanker-says-about-iran">Ebrahim Raisi</a>, the arch-conservative president who was elected last year, has given his goons a freer hand to enforce dress codes. Police are cracking down harshly on protesters (activists say they have already killed several). On Wednesday authorities restricted access to the internet, a familiar page from their playbook to quell dissent. The unrest comes amid surging inflation, a stalemate in nuclear talks with the West and rumours about the supreme leader’s health. Many Iranians were primed to explode. Ms Amini’s death was a spark.</p>
<h3>Putin’s desperate measures</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For months President Vladimir Putin reassured the Russian people that his “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/international/2022/05/17/the-putin-show">special military operation</a>” in Ukraine was going to plan. But on Wednesday he announced a “partial mobilisation”, meaning that Russians with army experience or in the reserves may be conscripted. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The announcement <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/20/vladimir-putins-situation-looks-ever-more-desperate">projects desperation</a>. Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, claims fewer than 6,000 soldiers have died in Ukraine. But he also said that 300,000 more would be mobilised. That would be a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/08/25/ukraine-and-russia-both-need-more-soldiers">larger force</a> than that which first invaded Ukraine in February.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Putin promised draftees “additional military training”. But many of the officers who could deliver that are dead, wounded or already on the front lines. And mobilisation is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/russian-discontent-with-the-war-and-vladimir-putin-is-growing">unpopular</a>. On Tuesday night internet searches for “how to leave Russia” rocketed. As Russia discovered in 1917, when the Bolshevik revolution toppled the monarchy, giving arms to people who do not wish to fight can be risky.</p>
<h3>A horrific year in the Sahel</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Discussion of the Sahel, a strip of land on the southern border of the Sahara desert, will take place at the UN on Thursday. It will be a grim conversation. Jihadists affiliated with al-Qaeda and Islamic State have made it the world’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/05/the-worlds-centre-of-terrorism-has-shifted-to-the-sahel">terrorism hotspot</a>. Last year the region accounted for one-third of all terrorism deaths. So far, this year appears worse yet.<br/><br/> To tackle the jihadists, the military junta that rules Mali <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/01/15/small-bands-of-mercenaries-extend-russias-reach-in-africa">brought in</a> Russian mercenaries from the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation">Wagner Group</a>. France, which had previously led the fight, then pulled its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/19/france-has-withdrawn-its-final-troops-from-mali">troops out</a>. Wagner-linked massacres of civilians are spiralling. The UN’s peacekeeping force remains, for now. Some 3,600 people have been killed in Mali already, almost double the total for the whole of last year.<br/><br/> In Burkina Faso, meanwhile, in January soldiers seized power in a coup, promising better security. Yet this year will be Burkina’s deadliest ever. Niger, a democracy, is having a better year than its neighbours but even there more than 700 people have been killed so far.</p>
<h3>The case against Imran Khan</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday Pakistan’s high court is expected to indict Imran Khan for contempt of court. The move is related to the former prime minister’s claim that a judge knew that one of Mr Khan’s aides had been tortured in police custody, but refused to release him. The court last week ruled that Mr Khan could not be charged with the more serious offence of terrorism. But the lesser charge still carries risks.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">If Mr Khan is found guilty, he could be barred from politics for five years. He therefore accuses his opponents of using the law against him. He may have a point. Since Mr Khan lost office after a parliamentary confidence vote in April his antics, and those of his supporters, have been a headache for his successor, Shehbaz Sharif. Mr Khan has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2022/08/25/on-the-comeback-trail-with-imran-khan">exploited</a> Mr Sharif’s struggles with Pakistan’s economy and the fallout from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/devastating-floods-like-pakistans-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world">devastating floods</a> to boost his own popularity. That will not end in court.</p>
<h3>Natural disasters on screen</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The trailer for “Thai Cave Rescue” promises “heroic stories…you haven’t heard about”. The six-part television series, released on Netflix on Thursday, dramatises the rescue of 12 boys <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2018/07/05/the-thai-cave-rescue">trapped in a cave</a> in 2018. It seems unlikely that many viewers will be unfamiliar with the tale. When unexpected rainfall caused the Wild Boars football team to become stuck for 17 days in northern Thailand, their plight was broadcast around the world. The event has since been memorialised in two other films and a documentary. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The saga combines an audience-winning formula of high stakes, heroics and a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2018/07/12/deliverance-for-thailands-cave-trapped-footballers">happy ending</a>. But plucky tales of survival may seem out of touch when disasters caused by extreme weather are increasingly frequent. Climate change is making rainfall more erratic, and flooding more common. In the past month alone,<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/devastating-floods-like-pakistans-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world"> flooding in Pakistan</a> has killed 1,400 people and displaced 33m. Those victims are unlikely to receive the Hollywood treatment.</p>
