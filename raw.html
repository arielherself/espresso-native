<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea</strong> fired a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/04/07/north-korea-is-testing-icbms-again-nuclear-weapons-may-be-next">ballistic missile</a> over <strong>Japan</strong> for the first time in five years. Japanese officials issued a warning to residents in Aomori and Hokkaido in the north of the country to take cover, and temporarily suspended some trains. Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, described the move as “barbaric”. South Korea accused North Korea of “reckless provocations”. It was North Korea’s fifth launch in ten days. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Stocks in <strong>Asia</strong> and <strong>Europe</strong> rallied, continuing a trend seen in the American markets, as expectations rose that central banks might ease the pace of interest rate rises in response to an economic slowdown. <strong>Australia’s</strong> central bank raised <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/29/global-rate-rises-are-happening-on-an-unprecedented-scale">interest rates</a> by a quarter of a percentage point, which was smaller than analysts had expected, but still pushed the policy rate to its highest in more than nine years.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A group of <strong>Russian</strong> lawyers said that they were overwhelmed with requests from men trying to avoid being drafted to fight in Ukraine. Since President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation on September 21st hundreds of thousands have also fled to neighbouring countries. Meanwhile Russian officials admitted that <strong>Ukrainian forces</strong> have <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame">made a breakthrough</a> in the southern region of Kherson.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Donald Trump</strong>, America’s former president, sued CNN for defamation, claiming over $475m in damages, according to a district court filing in Florida. The suit alleges that the news organisation smeared Mr Trump with increasingly “defamatory labels”, including comparisons with Adolf Hitler, the Nazi dictator. The move comes amid Mr Trump’s own <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm">legal problems</a> at both federal and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/09/21/donald-trump-faces-a-sweeping-new-lawsuit">state levels</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>Solomon Islands</strong> revealed it persuaded <strong>America</strong> to remove references to <strong>China</strong> from the regional partnership declaration that the pair signed last week, along with more than a dozen Pacific-island countries. The Solomon Islands signed a security deal with China earlier this year and did not want to “choose sides”, according to the country’s foreign minister. America and China are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/06/02/chinas-interest-in-the-pacific-islands-is-growing">vying for influence</a> in the region. </p>

<h3>The Kremlin’s botched land grab</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Russian parliament’s approval of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts">illegal annexation</a> of four Ukrainian regions, finalised by its upper house on Tuesday, rubber-stamped President Vladimir Putin’s proclamation that Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhia are part of Russia following <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/27/vladimir-putin-stages-four-fake-referendums-in-occupied-ukraine">fake referendums</a>. The legislation now returns to Mr Putin for his signing into law.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Mr Putin’s alternative reality adds to his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame">mounting problems</a>. The annexations mean that Russia does not control territories it claims. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains on multiple fronts, taking Lyman, a logistics hub in Donetsk, while pushing back into Kherson province in the south. The setbacks are sowing divisions among Russia’s elite. Nezavisimaya, an influential Russian newspaper, called the loss of Lyman “a political problem”, citing Chechnya’s leader, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/16/who-is-ramzan-kadyrov-the-brutal-chechen-leader-claiming-to-be-in-ukraine">Ramzan Kadyrov</a>, who blamed senior military figures for making poor tactical decisions. The rebukes do not yet target Mr Putin, but further losses will only heighten tensions among his lieutenants.</p>
<h3>America’s worker shortage drags on</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey used to be a sideshow in American economic data. Over the past year it has become an essential indicator, providing a glimpse into the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/05/why-businesses-are-furiously-hiring-even-as-a-downturn-looms">ultra-tight job market</a>. On Tuesday it is likely to show that 11m jobs were open in August, roughly double the number of unemployed people. Such a pronounced shortage of workers explains why wages are soaring, putting upward pressure on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/films/2022/08/04/inflation-and-the-global-economy">inflation</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Optimistic economists say that America can have a slowdown in inflation without suffering a steep rise in unemployment. For that to happen, they would want to see a fall in job openings, while the unemployment rate—due next on Friday—holds steady. Pessimists argue that it will take a big hit to growth for job openings to truly fall. Unfortunately, pessimists have a better track record in their forecasts over the past couple of years.</p>
<h3>The knotty making of Italy’s government</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The leadership of the Northern League, an Italian populist party, meets on Tuesday to choose which of its politicians it wants to sit at Giorgia Meloni’s cabinet table. Ms Meloni, the leader of the hard-right Brothers of Italy and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/25/italy-chooses-a-party-with-a-neo-fascist-legacy">prime minister-in-waiting</a>, is struggling to form a team that reassures Italy’s allies and satisfies her partners in the hard right coalition that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/italys-next-government-may-be-more-nationalist-than-europe-likes">won September’s election</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Meloni will struggle to place Matteo Salvini, the League’s pugnacious secretary. He wants to resume the campaign against irregular immigration he waged as interior minister in 2018-19. One option is putting him back in charge of law and order. But Mr Salvini is on trial for blocking migrants from entering port while in office. There is talk of a deputy premiership. But his past support for Russia makes Italy’s allies in NATO suspicious. He could also be given responsibility for agriculture. But would Mr Salvini, strongly critical of the EU, accept a portfolio in which most important decisions are taken in Brussels?</p>
<h3>A police shooting in London</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On September 5th a Metropolitan Police officer shot dead Chris Kaba, an unarmed black man, after chasing the car he was driving through south London. The killing drew hundreds of protesters to Scotland Yard, London’s police headquarters, to decry racism. Little is known about what caused the officer, who has been suspended, to shoot. An automated system linked the vehicle’s number plates to an earlier firearms offence. But more will become clear after an inquest into Mr Kaba’s death opens on Tuesday. The killing is also being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, a watchdog.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Kaba’s death puts Britain’s largest police force under fresh scrutiny. Buffeted by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/londons-metropolitan-police-service-is-failing-on-three-fronts/21807604">scandals</a>, the Met was recently <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/06/30/the-metropolitan-police-is-put-into-special-measures">put under examination</a> by another watchdog and required to produce a remedial plan for its failures. Its new commissioner, Mark Rowley, promised to be “ruthless” in rooting out wrongdoing. Dealing with the investigation into Mr Kaba’s death will be an early test.</p>
<h3>Pamuk muses on pandemics and politics</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Orhan Pamuk, Turkey’s most famous writer, had already spent a few years working on his new novel, a story set against the backdrop of a bubonic plague outbreak in the Ottoman empire in the early 1900s, when the covid pandemic struck. The prolonged lockdowns and concerns about his own health inspired copious rewrites. The resulting book, “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/05/01/turkeys-best-known-author-reflects-on-politics-and-pestilence">Nights of Plague</a>”, which came out in Turkish last year, is released in America on Tuesday. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The novel centres on a murder mystery on a fictional Ottoman island inhabited by both Turks and Greeks, but also muses about the power of modern states. Some of Mr Pamuk’s characters are familiar: Abdulhamid II, a sultan who struggles to save the Ottoman empire, shares autocratic and Islamist tendencies with Turkey’s president, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/06/09/as-elections-approach-turkeys-president-finds-enemies-everywhere">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>. Another resembles the country’s founder, Kemal Ataturk. For a historical novel, “Nights of Plague” can feel quite contemporary.</p>
