<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia </strong>increased attacks on Zaporizhia, a city in southern <strong>Ukraine</strong>, where at least 12 civilians died over the last two days. Ukrainian officials suggest that Russia employed Iranian-supplied drones alongside ongoing missile attacks. Amid <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame">growing criticism</a> of Russia’s military leadership, the commander of its eastern military district, Alexander Chaiko, has been fired according to RBC, a Russian news outlet. Ukraine has recently made <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/06/ukraine-has-made-stunning-gains-on-the-battlefield">significant advances</a> on both the eastern and southern fronts.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This year’s <strong>Nobel peace prize</strong> was awarded to one individual and two organisations fighting authoritarianism in the post-Soviet region.

Among the poor performers was Advanced Micro Devices: its share price tumbled by nearly 14% after the chipmaker cut its forecast for third-quarter revenues by more than $1bn. Levi Strauss shed more than 11% in value after the retailer reported lower-than-expected earnings.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s labour market </strong>slowed slightly in September as aggressive rate rises targeting high <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem">inflation</a> have cooled the economy. Official data recorded 263,000 new jobs, which was fewer than the 315,000 positions added in August, but better than expected. That resilience may invite further <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/14/to-fix-americas-inflation-problem-the-federal-reserve-must-go-big">tightening</a> from the Fed at its next meeting on November 2nd.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A UN agency said its 193 members agreed to eliminate greenhouse-gas <strong>emissions</strong> in the <strong>civil-aviation</strong> sector by 2050. China, which is set to overtake America as the biggest aviation market this decade, expressed doubt over <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/special-report/2021/02/11/how-todays-reviled-airlines-could-become-greener">reaching the goal</a>. European countries that had sought a more ambitious target called the non-binding deal a “compromise”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s</strong> commerce department imposed <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/01/29/will-china-dominate-the-world-of-semiconductors">new limits</a> on the export of advanced computer <strong>chips</strong> to <strong>China</strong>. Firms will need to acquire a licence to export the chips, which America said China was using to advance its army’s technological prowess and “commit human rights abuses”. China called the move “sci-tech hegemony”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Credit</strong><strong> Suisse</strong> said it would buy back up to $3bn of its own debt in a bid to reassure investors <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/03/credit-suisse-and-the-hunt-for-the-weakest-link-in-global-finance">amid persistent concerns</a> about its liquidity.

<h3>Europe’s property slowdown</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">House prices across Britain and the EU have spiralled since the start of the pandemic. But not for much longer, according to two separate indices published on Friday. Halifax, a British lender, said prices edged down by 0.1% in September from a record high in August. The typical price of a house in Britain is now £293,835 ($330,000). Meanwhile, Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, reported the first slowdown in two years. House prices in the EU rose by 9.3% between the second quarters of this year and last year, down from the annual rise of 9.8% in the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Higher mortgage rates and a cost-of-living squeeze are<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/01/the-global-housing-boom-is-running-out-of-steam"> dampening buyer enthusiasm</a>. A meltdown akin to America’s subprime crisis when prices fell by a third looks unlikely: a chronic shortage of homes has seen prices across the EU soar by<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20220708-1"></a>45% since 2010. Tight labour markets, which improve household finances, mean that homes are still being snapped up. But as the market cools, a reversal could be around the corner.</p>
<h3>Will Ohio’s abortion ban survive?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The overturning of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/how-the-end-of-roe-v-wade-will-affect-american-politics/21809130"><em>Roe v Wade</em></a> in June has opened up a battleground in the Buckeye state. The removal of federal protections opened the way for Ohio’s “trigger ban”, introduced in 2019, to come into force. It prohibited almost all abortions after six weeks. But in mid-September a judge in Hamilton County temporarily suspended the law, on the grounds that Ohio’s constitution guarantees a “fundamental right to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice”. His ruling, which lasts until October 12th, was a victory for pro-choice campaigners.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday the court will hold another hearing on the injunction. And specific abortion cases are percolating through the courts. In June a ten-year-old was forced to travel to Indiana from Ohio for an abortion after being raped. Indiana’s Republican attorney-general threatened to prosecute the doctor who performed the abortion, claiming, incorrectly, that she had not filed the correct paperwork; she is now suing him for defamation. The battles over abortion show no sign of losing steam.</p>
<h3>A breakup over independence in Catalonia</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday one of Catalonia’s governing parties, Junts per Catalunya, announced that members had voted for the party to leave the regional government. This leaves its former partner, Esquerra Republicana, stranded and looking to redesign a working majority. Both Junts and Esquerra back Catalan independence, and supported the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/09/26/why-the-referendum-on-catalan-independence-is-illegal">illegal independence referendum</a> of October 2017, which prompted the national government in Madrid to suspend the region’s self-rule. After a bare majority of voters chose pro-independence parties in last year’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2021/02/15/catalonias-separatists-score-another-victory-but-a-hollow-one">regional elections</a>, many separatist politicians took the result as a mandate to press on.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the partners were divided on how to do so. Esquerra bet on a formal dialogue with the government in Madrid, hoping to win concessions. Junts did not take part, and wound up acting as both a governing party and a kind of opposition. Now, Esquerra will need votes from non-independentist parties to govern; those groups will want to move on from the independence question to the economy.</p>
<h3>Little Lesotho makes a big decision</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The general election in Lesotho on Friday will be one of the least-watched votes in the world this year. The neglect is understandable: Lesotho is a poor and tiny country of just 2.2m people, entirely encircled by South Africa. Yet a new government could jolt the former British protectorate to turn the page on a tumultuous recent history. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Since independence in 1966 Lesotho has seen coups, attempted coups, prime ministers fleeing the country, assassinations of military bosses, unstable coalition governments and, most recently, a former prime minister <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/01/23/one-first-lady-is-dead-in-lesotho-another-has-fled">accused of conspiring</a> with his third wife to murder his second. (The charges were dropped in July.) <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/01/25/corruption-is-getting-worse-in-many-poor-countries">Corruption</a> and crime are rampant. Politics is about access to spoils, not the pursuit of the greater good.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The next government will probably be another coalition involving ideologically indistinguishable parties. As pressure from donors and civil society mounts, its priority should be to pass constitutional reforms. That is, if it is not too busy at the trough to bother.</p>
<h3>The Beatles and Bond, 60 years on</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Sixty years ago this week the Beatles released their debut single, “Love Me Do”, and the first James Bond film, “Dr No”, premiered at the London Pavilion. Neither was an instant hit. Liverpool’s finest failed to make Britain’s top ten, whilst Sean Connery’s Bond was roasted by the critics, one calling him “a great big hairy marshmallow”. Things worked out in the end, of course; the 25 official Bond films have made more than $7bn at the box office, and the Beatles retain most of the world records for shifting pop music.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">John Higgs explores the seismic, and intertwining, cultural impact of the Beatles and Bond in his new book, “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/09/22/sixty-years-ago-james-bond-and-the-beatles-made-debuts">Love and Let Die</a>”. Both heralded a vivid, technicolour break with the buttoned-up wartime generation. Yet, as Mr Higgs writes, alongside the jetset modernity, the Bond films cleaved to attitudes on women and class that were already reactionary, and the Beatles won acclaim with the “faux Victoriana” of “Sgt. Pepper”. Little wonder they were so popular in Britain.</p>
