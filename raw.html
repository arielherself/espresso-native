<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> said <strong>Russia</strong> is not complying with New START, the two countries’ last remaining <strong>nuclear-arms</strong> control treaty. Russia has suspended weapons inspections and pulled out of consultations, officials from America’s State Department said in a report to Congress. The compliance failures heighten concerns that the two powers will be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/07/31/will-the-ukraine-war-ring-the-knell-for-nuclear-arms-control">unable to negotiate</a> an extension to New START, which expires in 2026. Meanwhile, America is preparing to send more aid to Ukraine to help it repel Russia’s attacks. The package, reported to be worth more than $2bn, could include long-range rockets.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America </strong>and<strong> India</strong> launched several defence and technology initiatives to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. They will co-operate in several areas, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors and weapons production. Many countries have adopted <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2023/01/04/reinventing-the-indo-pacific">similar Indo-Pacific strategies</a> in recent years. America is also hoping to wean India off its reliance on Russian weapons.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The pace of <strong>euro-zone inflation </strong>slowed to an annual rate of 8.5% in January, according to preliminary figures, the third <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/24/how-the-world-economy-could-avoid-recession">monthly decrease</a> in a row. Lower energy costs are largely responsible for the deceleration. But core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, remains at an all-time high. European central bankers are expected to hike interest rates again on Thursday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Shares in the <strong>Adani Group</strong>, a vast <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2023/01/31/nagging-questions-over-the-adani-empire-wont-go-away">Indian conglomerate</a> that ranges from cement to media, fell again on Wednesday. The company has now lost $84bn in market value since Hindenburg Research, a short-seller, declared that the business empire was a giant con. The group successfully raised $2.5bn in a share offering ending on Tuesday, but this has not diminished investors’ scepticism.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The largest day of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/11/03/britain-faces-a-wave-of-industrial-action-this-winter">industrial action</a> in at least ten years began in <strong>Britain </strong>as teachers, civil servants, train drivers, and university lecturers walked out over pay and working conditions. Around 500,000 workers are expected to participate. Britain’s government warned of “significant disruption”, with thousands of schools closed. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/12/19/british-nurses-launch-unprecedented-strikes">Healthworkers</a> and firefighters are planning more strikes soon.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Factory activity</strong> in several <strong>Asian countries</strong> shrank in January amid <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/24/how-the-world-economy-could-avoid-recession">slowing growth</a> in America and Europe. Manufacturing indices in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all contracted. Chinese factories were hit by staff absences because of surging covid-19 infections. However, activity in South-East Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, picked up.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Australian</strong> authorities found a tiny <strong>radioactive capsule</strong> after a week-long search along a 1,400km highway in the country’s expansive wilderness. The pellet was part of a tool that measured iron ore at a mine owned by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/rio-tinto-and-the-problem-of-toxic-culture/21807599">Rio Tinto, a global mining giant</a>. People were told to stay at least five metres from the capsule to avoid radiation.</p>

<h3>Downshift, not dovish shift, for the Fed</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Federal Reserve is reducing the intensity of its monetary tightening. It is widely expected on Wednesday to raise interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point. That would be smaller than its last increase, a half-point <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">in December</a>, which itself was a step down after a series of three-quarter-point <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done">increases</a>. The shift to smaller increments reflects the fact that, with rates now high enough to restrict economic activity, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2023/01/26/the-world-economys-inflation-problem-is-easing">inflation</a> has started to decelerate.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s central bank has a tricky task. Many investors think it is moving away from hawkishness, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/12/20/the-year-of-the-rate-shock">perhaps</a> opening the door to rate cuts before the year’s end. That has helped cause a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/24/how-the-world-economy-could-avoid-recession">rebound</a> in stock and bond prices over the past month. But the Fed worries that excessive rallies could undo its work to tame inflation. So Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, may deliver a stern message to try to rein in the bulls before they charge too far ahead.</p>
<h3>Investigating covid jobless claims</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">During the pandemic American states paid out billions of dollars in covid relief, including $794bn in hastily arranged aid schemes to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/01/31/americas-covid-job-saving-programme-gave-most-of-its-cash-to-the-rich">unemployed workers</a>. But fraud was rife. Scammers claimed benefits using stolen social-security numbers, taking the details of prisoners and even the dead. On Thursday the House Oversight Committee will hold a hearing to investigate <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/30/vast-sums-of-money-have-gone-missing-from-pandemic-stimulus-programmes">fraudulent claims</a>—which by some estimates could total as much as $400bn<em>.</em><br/><br/> With the Republicans now in control of the House, the Oversight Committee has new ambitions.<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/09/27/what-would-republicans-do-with-a-house-majority"> James Comer</a>, the new chair of the committee, wants to use it as a platform to scrutinise President Joe Biden and his administration more widely. Mr Biden’s family’s business dealings, migrants at the southern border and America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan are all on the table. Benefit fraud, the focus of this hearing, will be hard to pin on Mr Biden, however. The aid program was established during Donald Trump’s term and only extended by Mr Biden a year later.</p>
<h3>India’s budget-balancing act</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday India’s government presented its budget for the coming fiscal year. Nirmala Sitharaman, the finance minister, announced plans to ramp up capital spending by 33% to “kickstart a virtuous cycle of investment and job creation”. That will be needed. Unemployment is rising and a global economic slowdown risks tempering <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-indian-economy-remains-a-bright-spot-in-south-asia">India’s growth</a>. Tax breaks were announced for middle-income earners, perhaps with an eye on upcoming elections. Nine states head to the polls in 2023 and this was the last full budget before a general election in 2024.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">With inflation close to the central bank’s upper limit of 6% and government debt rising, the budget includes some belt-tightening. Spending on social-welfare schemes were cut. Ms Sitharaman also promised to lower the government’s fiscal deficit to 5.9% of GDP. That would be an improvement over the 6.4% in this fiscal year, but still well above the long-term target of 3%.</p>
<h3>Myanmar’s state of emergency</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2015 and 2020 Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won democratic elections in Myanmar and led the first civilian governments in decades. But Wednesday marks two years since the army took back power <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2023/01/31/myanmars-civil-war-has-moved-to-its-heartlands">in a coup</a> and shattered the country’s young democracy, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2021/12/11/myanmars-generals-want-aung-san-suu-kyi-locked-up-forever">locking Ms Suu Kyi up</a> for good measure.<br/><br/> It is also decision time for the army, which looks set to extend the state of emergency that it declared on the day of the coup. That keeps power in the hands of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2023/01/12/myanmars-generals-are-deeply-superstitious">General Min Aung Hlaing</a>, who is also the prime minister, and who has failed to quell an anti-coup uprising that is becoming enmeshed in the country’s old ethnic conflicts.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Speculation abounds nevertheless that the regime will try to hold sham elections this year and begin a showy transition to a veneer of civilian government. The UN warns that a vote during the civil war would “fuel greater violence” as resistance fighters try to derail the polls. Peace has rarely felt so remote.</p>
<h3>“One Woman Show” goes down under</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Liz Kingsman’s rise has been impressive. “One Woman Show”, written and performed by the Australian-British comedian, launched in a 50-seat venue just before the pandemic closed theatres in 2020. In 2022 it moved to London’s West End. On Wednesday it began a run at Sydney Opera House.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The one-woman show, in which a performer plays several characters, has a place in entertainment history. The form launched such comedians as Whoopi Goldberg. Ms Kingsman’s “One Woman Show” is a hilarious deconstruction of the genre. It parodies a trend, inspired by Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s “Fleabag”, in which a young female protagonist narrates her fashionably out-of-control life.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">“One Woman Show” lampoons the vogue for revealing the personal. “It’s almost as if the more explicit this is, the braver I am,” explains Ms Kingsman’s on-stage alter-ego. It mocks, too, the way confessional comedy can lead to personal success. That her parody has brought her fame is, the real-life Ms Kingsman admits, “deeply ironic”.</p>
