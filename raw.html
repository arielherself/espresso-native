<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukrainian</strong> officials said that electricity supplies had been restored in Kharkiv, the country’s second-biggest city, and water was back on in Kyiv, the capital, after a wave of <strong>Russian</strong> missile attacks on the country’s infrastructure on Friday. An 18-month-old boy was among four people killed by the strikes in Kryvyi Rih, in the south. General Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/ukraines-fateful-winter">told <em>The Economist</em></a> this week that the Russians were preparing for a major offensive in the next few months, including “another go at Kyiv”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">With <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/12/13/how-chinese-people-are-dealing-with-the-spread-of-covid-19">cases of <strong>covid-19</strong></a> on the rise in China, certain pupils in Shanghai will be sent home from Monday to continue studying online. The ruling affects those in kindergartens and child-care centres, plus older year groups that are not due to graduate in the summer. A wave of infections is breaking over the country, after the government largely ditched its zero-covid policy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Polls opened in <strong>Tunisia’s</strong> first parliamentary elections since the legislature was closed by Kais Saied, the country’s president, in July 2021. The opposition is boycotting the vote, decrying it as a farce designed to cement Mr Saied’s control. It is unclear how many Tunisians will turn out—a referendum on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/08/25/dictators-and-utopians-are-fond-of-fiddling-with-constitutions">constitutional reforms</a> granting the president unchecked power attracted only 28% of eligible voters.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Leo Varadkar</strong> became Ireland’s taoiseach (prime minister) for a second time. Under a “rotating taoiseach” deal, Micheal Martin, the leader of Fianna Fail, with which Mr Varadkar’s Fine Gael governs in coalition, held the job for the first half of the current parliament. Now it is Mr Varadkar’s turn again (he was previously in office from 2017 to 2020).</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Uganda </strong>lifted a two-month lockdown amid cautious optimism that its Ebola outbreak is improving. The east African country’s president, Yoweri Museveni, ended restrictions in Mubende and Kassanda, two of the hardest-hit regions. Since authorities declared the outbreak in September, Uganda has recorded 142 cases and 56 deaths from the disease.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Croatia</strong> beat <strong>Morocco</strong> 2-1 to claim third place in the football World Cup. Romantics were probably hoping for a win for the Moroccans, who had become <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/13/moroccos-world-cup-success-sparks-a-debate-about-arab-identity">the first African or Arab squad</a> to reach the semi-finals. But a Croatian team led by one of the modern game’s great players, Luka Modric, secured another impressive result, four years after being runners-up. The reigning champions, France, take on Argentina in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/12/16/the-world-cup-final-pits-messi-against-mbappe">Sunday’s final</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>German</strong> police said they had recovered 31 objects from a <strong>jewellery heist</strong> in 2019 at the Royal Palace in Dresden, a state museum. Lavishly encrusted treasures then valued at €114m ($125m) were stolen from a collection assembled in the 18th century by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony. Six men are on trial for the robbery. The recovery followed discussions between prosecutors and the defence team.</p>

<h3>What lies ahead in Ukraine</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In the past week Russia launched a further barrage of rockets on Ukrainian infrastructure, as it seeks to disable the country’s power grid amid freezing winter temperatures. More will surely follow. But the strikes could also precede Russian moves on the battlefield. Ukraine’s top generals believe Russia is preparing <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/ukraines-fateful-winter">another big offensive</a>, possibly to begin as soon as January, that could come anywhere in the country. The question facing them is whether to launch a pre-emptive strike or wait to counter-attack.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine insists that the only way to conclude the war is a complete Russian retreat, from land seized this year and from territory it has occupied since 2014, including Crimea. But in private officials admit to other possible outcomes, with Ukrainian military advances leading to diplomacy. A European official says that ideally Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, would be persuaded that the war is unwinnable, and that prolonging it would risk even his pre-war holdings—Crimea and one-third of the eastern Donbas region—forcing him into talks. Yet compromise over Crimea in particular will be hard to swallow for an increasingly optimistic Ukraine.</p>
<h3>Sudan’s fitful democratic transition</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Monday marks the fourth anniversary of the outbreak of protests that eventually toppled Omar al-Bashir, a genocidal dictator who ruled Sudan for three decades. The country’s indefatigable democracy activists will again take to the streets in a show of commemoration and defiance. After the revolution, the army accepted a power-sharing deal with civilians; three years later, as elections loomed, the generals <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/sudans-democratic-transition-is-upended-by-a-second-coup-in-two-years/21805857">staged a coup</a>. Protesters have been on the streets <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/09/sudan-faces-collapse-three-years-after-the-fall-of-its-dictator">every week since</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Now they have further reason to be angry. Earlier this month leaders of the civilian bloc and the junta signed a new accord promising a fully civilian government and elections in two years. Activists are suspicious: the agreement was negotiated behind closed doors by a coterie of politicians and generals who are widely mistrusted. The most contentious issue—prosecution of the generals for genocide and crimes against humanity—will supposedly be dealt with later, sparking fears that it never will be.</p>
<h3>The science of pads and tampons</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">At any given time, about 300m of the world’s women are menstruating. Of these, three-quarters will be using a menstrual product—tampons, pads, pantyliners and so on—to regulate their flow. A typical woman who employs such devices will use around 15,000 of them during her life.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet rigorous studies into the composition of menstrual products are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/12/14/not-enough-is-known-about-the-science-of-pads-and-tampons">remarkably patchy</a>. Official reports have found few dangers, and any serious health hazards would probably have come to light by now. Even a small risk, though, would affect many people. And in some parts of the world, from America to Kenya and South Korea, women have reported symptoms including shorter periods, cramps and rashes when using certain pads. The two largest makers of menstrual products say they give priority to safety, and deny using harmful chemicals. But companies’ verdicts on their own products can’t be taken as gospel. The onus is on scientists, regulators and public-health agencies to fill in the gaps in knowledge.</p>
<h3>A clash of superstars in the World Cup final</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For some, this year’s World Cup in Qatar has been <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/11/10/the-world-cup-is-tarnished-should-fans-enjoy-it-anyway">marred by concerns</a> about human rights. On the pitch the tournament will be remembered for major <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even">upsets,</a> as teams such as Morocco and Japan bested European giants. Yet Sunday’s final, between Argentina and France, has a familiar feel. Over the past 40 years, just five countries account for 19 of the 22 World Cup finalists: Brazil, Germany (West Germany before 1990), Italy and this year’s pair. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">France have recent pedigree, winning the cup in 1998 and 2018. Argentina’s last win was in 1986, though they were defeated finalists in 1990 and 2014. Both sides boast <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/12/16/the-world-cup-final-pits-messi-against-mbappe">superstars</a>: Kylian Mbappé, France’s young talisman, and Lionel Messi, one of the world’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/11/17/lionel-messi-and-cristiano-ronaldo-have-forged-modern-football">greatest-ever players</a>. And in attack the teams look evenly matched. Argentina have created 11.8 “expected goals”, a measure of goalscoring intent, in the tournament so far, and France 11.6. But Argentina have a stronger defensive record. That could give them the edge.</p>
<h3>“His Dark Materials” on the small screen</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“His Dark Materials” has all the right ingredients. The television show is adapted from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2007/12/01/philip-pullmans-dark-arts">Philip Pullman’s</a> beloved fantasy novels, which have sold more than 17m copies worldwide. Jack Thorne, one of the screenwriters, is a BAFTA winner. The BBC and HBO have reached deep into their pockets—it is reportedly the BBC’s most expensive show ever—to fund the whizzy special effects. And it features a starry cast, including Ruth Wilson, Andrew Scott, Lin-Manuel Miranda and James McAvoy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet although audiences enjoyed the first two seasons, most will probably find the third and final instalment, released in Britain on Sunday, and already streaming on HBO Max in America, more challenging. The first two followed Lyra (Dafne Keen) as she searched for a missing friend and learned about the Magisterium, a forbidding religious authority. The third tells a complex allegorical tale tracing several characters and requiring lots of exposition. Some stories, it seems, work best on the page.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul facing prosecution</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As the former head of his family’s construction company, Ekrem Imamoglu says he often saw projects get bogged down by politics. He says he entered politics to untangle the red tape. That line got him elected mayor of a suburb of Istanbul in 2014 as a member of Turkey’s main opposition outfit, the Republican People’s Party (CHP). Five years later Mr Imamoglu was elected mayor of the whole city, but only after Justice and Development (AK), the party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, contested the initial vote. Mr Imamoglu <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2019/06/24/the-oppositions-new-star-deals-turkeys-president-a-stinging-blow">won the rerun election by a landslide</a>. His victory was a heavy blow for Mr Erdogan, himself a former mayor of Istanbul who is fond of saying that “whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">As mayor Mr Imamoglu has focused on quality-of-life issues in Europe’s most populous city, expanding the metro to ease traffic and improving storm-drainage to reduce flash-flooding. The president knows that the opposition’s successful management of Istanbul poses risks to his 20-year tenure in office, given that presidential elections are expected by June 2023. The CHP has yet to name a candidate to take on Mr Erdogan, and Mr Imamoglu has stayed mum on his ambitions for higher office. But polls suggest that he is one of the opposition politicians best placed to unseat Mr Erdogan at the ballot box.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Naturally charismatic, Mr Imamoglu is a rare unifying figure in Turkey’s polarised political landscape. He is religious and progressive. He is a Turk from the ultra-nationalist Black Sea region, but also appeals to minority voters like Kurds and Alevis. His appeal makes him a highly <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/06/09/as-elections-approach-turkeys-president-finds-enemies-everywhere">dangerous rival to Mr Erdogan</a>. On December 14th a court in Istanbul convicted Mr Imamoglu of “insulting” the officials who had ordered the rerun of the Istanbul mayoral election, whom he had called “fools”. He was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison, and banned from holding political office. An appeal is under way, but if it fails the ruling could bar Mr Imamoglu from challenging Mr Erdogan and AK at any level.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Supporters of Mr Imamoglu think the case is politically motivated. But most analysts reckon that, if his conviction is overturned, it could rally voters behind him. After all, Mr Erdogan was catapulted to power after serving four months in prison for reading a religious poem. A ruling in Mr Imamoglu’s favour by the appeals court could just see him follow suit. </p>
