<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that his country’s troops had made steady progress in their <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/russia-says-ukraines-counter-offensive-is-a-bloody-failure">counter-offensive</a> against occupying Russian forces in the east and south. But he warned Europe to expect a “difficult winter” of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/01/how-to-prevent-europes-energy-crunch-spiralling-into-an-economic-crisis">high fuel prices</a>. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said he was expecting €5bn ($5bn) in aid from the European Union this week, partly to help Ukrainians through the winter. On a trip to Berlin he also solicited Germany for more heavy weapons and air defence systems. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Voters in <strong>Chile</strong> rejected a <strong>new constitution</strong> intended to replace the one passed in 1980 under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-americas/2022/07/07/chiles-new-draft-constitution-would-shift-the-country-far-to-the-left">proposed constitution</a> would have enshrined costly new socio-economic rights, such as requiring a universal state-run health system. But Chileans are currently more concerned about inflation and rising crime. With nearly all votes counted, around 62% opposed the change.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">At least ten people were stabbed to death in Saskatchewan, a province in central <strong>Canada</strong>. The victims, including 15 injured, were found in several locations in the James Smith Cree Nation, an indigenous community, and the nearby village of Weldon. Two suspects, both men in their thirties with the same surname, are on the run. The motivation for the attacks is unclear.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A man who jumped to his death from a New York high-rise on Friday was confirmed as being <strong>Gustavo Arnal</strong>, the chief financial officer of the troubled <strong>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</strong> homeware chain. The value of the firm—a favoured “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/06/are-meme-stocks-harmless-fun-or-a-threat-to-the-financial-old-guard">meme stock</a>”—has fallen precipitously this year. Despite recently securing some refinancing, its future looks precarious. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Germany</strong> announced a €65bn ($64.7bn) <strong>relief package</strong> to help households and companies withstand soaring prices. The plan includes discounts on public transport and tax breaks for energy-intensive firms. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said his government had made “timely decisions” to avert <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/21/germans-have-been-living-in-a-dream">energy shortages</a> this winter. German inflation was close to 8% in August, with prices running particularly high for groceries and energy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Hamas</strong>, the militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, executed five Palestinians. Two of them had provided Israel with intelligence that led to strikes on Palestinian targets, Hamas authorities said. (The others had been convicted of murder.) The executions were the first in the Palestinian territories since 2017. Human-rights groups have criticised Hamas’s court proceedings, as well as the retention of the death penalty. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Donald Trump</strong> called <strong>President Joe Biden</strong> an “enemy of the state” during a rally in Pennsylvania.

<h3>Chile’s constitutional referendum</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Sunday Chileans <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-americas/2022/07/07/chiles-new-draft-constitution-would-shift-the-country-far-to-the-left">vote</a> on whether to reject or approve a new constitution. It would replace the current charter, which was drafted under a military dictatorship in 1980. The text was written by a convention of 155 representatives, assembled after protests against inequality in 2019. At 388 articles, it would be one of the world’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/06/countries-are-writing-ever-longer-constitutions">longest charters</a> and include the most extensive rights enshrined in any constitution. In addition to housing, work, health care, education and sports, Chileans would have the right to abortion. Indigneous peoples would be granted autonomous territories. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Such sweeping changes have perturbed many Chileans. Polls show that most plan to reject the draft text. Yet one factor could still upend the outcome. For the first time in a decade, voters will be fined if they do not cast a ballot. If young people turn out in droves, analysts say the constitution could yet be approved.</p>
<h3>The European energy rollercoaster</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Over the past two weeks energy traders have watched in disbelief as European gas and electricity markets <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/01/europe-scrambles-to-protect-consumers-against-dizzying-energy-prices">exploded</a>. Gas futures for the fourth quarter of 2022 briefly touched €350 ($350) per megawatt-hour (the typical pre-pandemic price was around €30). French daytime power—particularly expensive because demand is highest during the day—hit more than €2,500. For comparison, the running costs of a nuclear plant, of which France has many although most are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/frances-nuclear-plants-are-going-down-for-repairs">closed for maintenance</a>, are about €30 per MWh. The price bubble deflated, but settled at still-alarming levels, of €250 per MWh for gas and €1,750 for French daytime power. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Where next for European energy prices? Germany’s decision on whether to keep its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/01/08/why-germans-remain-so-jittery-about-nuclear-power">remaining three nuclear plants</a> open beyond December is due soon, and France is working on restarting more of its plants. Luckily Russia’s closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany on August 31st, supposedly for maintenance, barely moved markets. The impact of Russia’s attempts at energy blackmail may be weakening. </p>
<h3>The talented Patricia Highsmith</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In her final home in Switzerland, Patricia Highsmith cultivated a booze-soaked solitude. Fans still pursued her, eager to meet the author of “Strangers on a Train”, “The Talented Mr Ripley” and dozens of other haunting books, but Highsmith preferred her cats, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/01/20/a-poisonous-person-patricia-highsmith-was-an-enduring-writer">snails</a> and the people she invented on the page. “The difference between dream and reality is the true hell,” she once wrote.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet Highsmith was once young, hopeful and sexually irresistible. “She had a staggering amount of conquests,” recounts one former female lover in “Loving Highsmith”, Eva Vitija’s new documentary about the author’s secret love life, which opens in cinemas this weekend. Drawing from diaries, notebooks and conversations with former paramours, all of them women, the film depicts a fascinating woman at odds with herself. Although Highsmith wrote “The Price of Salt” (1952), the first novel about a lesbian love affair with a happy ending (better known now as “Carol”), her own relationships left her mired in self-loathing. In the end, her most beloved companions were her typewriter and her diaries, in which she once wrote: “Writing, of course, is a substitute for the life I cannot live, am unable to live.”</p>
<h3>Test-tube babies and cancer risks</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET), an increasingly popular method of in-vitro fertilisation, embryos are temporarily iced before being implanted in the uterus. Some evidence suggests this makes conception more likely than transferring them straight in. But children conceived using FET may also be more susceptible to cancer than those born through other means, according to a study in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, a journal. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Some 8m children were studied across Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Almost 23,000 of them had been conceived through FET. Of that group, 48 had been diagnosed with cancer, most commonly leukaemia and tumours of the central nervous system.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The number of cases is too low to prove a definitive link. And when researchers analysed all children born through IVF as one group, they found no increased cancer risk. But as more people use <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2022/02/14/tinder-drove-me-to-freeze-my-eggs">assisted reproduction</a>, further investigation of FET is warranted.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Liz Truss, Britain’s likely next prime minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">If Rishi Sunak becomes <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/07/21/the-choice-between-rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss">leader of the Conservative Party</a> on September 5th, it will be the greatest upset for the political polling industry since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton to win the American presidency in 2016. At present Liz Truss appears overwhelmingly likely to win the poll of Conservative members and succeed Boris Johnson as the party’s leader—and with it become <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/08/18/what-kind-of-prime-minister-will-britain-get">Britain’s prime minister</a>. Betting markets imply she has a 95% chance of prevailing. Who is she?</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Truss is one of the most experienced members of the British government. First elected in 2010, she joined the cabinet as agriculture secretary in 2014 under David Cameron. She continued at the top table under Mr Cameron’s successors, holding the posts of justice secretary, chief secretary to the Treasury, trade secretary and most recently foreign secretary.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">She has adopted the mantle of her hero, Margaret Thatcher. Her overriding priority is improving Britain’s low productivity through a combination of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/08/18/parsing-the-policies-of-liz-truss-and-rishi-sunak">tax cuts and regulatory reform</a>. She plans to cut payroll taxes and cancel a planned raise in corporation tax. Ms Truss brushes aside warnings that fiscal loosening would be inflationary. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">A large part of her appeal to Tory members is a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2021/04/08/liz-truss-and-the-power-of-perkiness">relentless optimism</a>. And also a loyalty to Mr Johnson who, despite being ousted by his colleagues in July after two scandal-plagued years, retains the affection of rank-and-file party members—not least for delivering Brexit. She is a forceful advocate of a new doctrine of muscular cultural conservatism in the modern Tory party: pro free speech, against revisionist historians and new gender theories.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Truss’s critics regard her as an oddity and a lightweight, not least for her invocations of Thatcher’s legacy. She is best known outside of Westminster for a gawky speech delivered as agricultural secretary, pledging to open up “pork markets”. Yet she has been repeatedly underestimated—including by Mr Sunak. </p>
