<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s stockmarkets</strong> suffered their worst day since June 2020 after data showed that annual inflation in August <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem" data-tegid="vofrsagt4ivs5mntau2gbjnha62acicq">exceeded forecasts</a> at 8.3%. (Britain’s inflation came in slightly below expectations, at 9.9%.) The S&amp;P 500 dropped by 4.4% and the Dow by 3.9%. The rout extended to <strong>Asian </strong>and<strong> European </strong>stockmarkets on Wednesday. Rising prices in America will keep pressure on the Federal Reserve as it weighs an interest-rate increase at its meeting next week. <strong>The dollar </strong>strengthened against the yen, almost touching a 24-year peak, as it chased yields on bond markets that expect rates to rise.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>European Commission’s</strong> president, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined plans for a windfall tax on energy companies that will aim to raise €140bn ($140bn). The levy would be used by member states to shield consumers and businesses from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices">sky-high</a> energy prices resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mrs von der Leyen suggested the EU was “in for the long haul” in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine’s</strong> ambassador to America described the country’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/09/ukraine-seizes-the-initiative-in-the-east">recent counter-offensive</a> against <strong>Russian</strong> forces as a “major turning-point” in the war. At least 150,000 Ukrainians in more than 300 settlements have been liberated from Russian occupation since September 6th, according to one official. On Tuesday night Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, urged Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, to withdraw his troops from Ukraine “as soon as possible”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A court in <strong>St Petersburg </strong>set in motion the dissolution of a local council, after some of its members called for Mr Putin to be removed from office. One of the councillors claimed they had also been fined 47,000 roubles ($780) for “discrediting” the regime. The Russian president is under pressure at home as the war in Ukraine goes sour.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Armenia </strong>claimed that <strong>Azerbaijan </strong>had restarted strikes on its territories, just a day after Russia said it had brokered a ceasefire between the Caucasian countries, with President Vladimir Putin “making every effort” to help de-escalate tensions. Both sides now claim that the truce has been broken by the other and that around 50 of their soldiers have been killed in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/13/why-azerbaijan-and-armenia-are-fighting-again">fighting</a>.

Next month they will test their competing claims in a Delaware court.

<h3>Xi Jinping’s first post-covid trip</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Nearly 1,000 days after he <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/09/08/xi-jinping-will-at-last-venture-abroad-again">last left China</a>, President Xi Jinping arrived in Central Asia on Wednesday. A summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation in Uzbekistan on Thursday and Friday offers Mr Xi an opportunity to support a fellow delegate: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Mr Xi’s first stop, though, is Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">China has invested heavily in the country, which sends back oil and gas. It was from Kazakhstan that Mr Xi in 2013 launched the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/05/14/what-is-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative">Belt and Road Initiative</a>, a global infrastructure binge. The country also borders China’s Muslim-majority Xinjiang province, where more than 1m Uyghurs have been thrown into “re-education” camps. Kazakhstan’s government has remained quiet on the matter.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In October Mr Xi is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as chief at a Communist Party congress. Travelling now looks like a sign of confidence. But he faces big challenges at home, not least over <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/09/08/public-patience-with-zero-covid-is-wearing-thin-in-china">frustration</a> with his “zero-covid” policy. For now, only diplomacy is returning to the pre-pandemic normal.</p>
<h3>The return of the Detroit motor show</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For the first time since the pandemic the latest cars are being shown off in Motor City. Many of them will be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/06/02/the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-not-happening-fast-enough">electric</a>. The North American International Auto Show, in Detroit, opens for journalists and industry insiders on Wednesday. President Joe Biden is also expected to attend, to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/09/13/joe-bidens-industrial-policy-is-big-bold-and-fraught-with-difficulty">promote</a> the investments in electric-car manufacturing that his infrastructure and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/08/08/americas-climate-plus-spending-bill-is-flawed-but-essential">climate-change laws</a> aim to boost.<br/><br/> Yet not everyone in Detroit is convinced that electric cars offer all the solutions. Some worry that their simplicity threatens the region’s engineering expertise, built on the combustion engine. Firms like Tesla and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/10/rivians-giant-listing-comes-amid-huge-losses">Rivian</a> do not make cars in Detroit. A wider worry is that EVs, which tend to be weightier than those which run on petrol, may bring fresh dangers to American roads. Road deaths are rising, and heavier vehicles are deadlier in crashes. Among the heaviest is the four-tonne Hummer EV—which is manufactured in Detroit.</p>
<h3>Google’s latest day in court</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday Google’s parent company, Alphabet, largely lost its appeal against the European Commission’s decision in 2018 to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2018/07/21/google-is-fined-eu43bn-in-the-biggest-ever-antitrust-penalty">impose a record anti-trust fine</a> of €4.3bn (then $5.1bn). The European Union’s executive branch said the firm’s licensing of its Android operating system to handset-makers had illegally helped it maintain its dominant position in the smartphone market. Judges at a court of the European Court of Justice upheld many of the arguments but decided that a modestly reduced fine of €4.1bn ($4.1bn) was more appropriate.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The case was the latest in a series in which the European Commission has tried to rein in America’s tech giants. Last year Alphabet also lost an appeal against <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2017/07/01/the-european-commission-levies-a-huge-fine-on-google">an antitrust fine</a> of €2.4bn, imposed by the commission in 2017 for abusing its monopoly in online search. But the court’s decisions have swung both ways. In June the court threw out a €1bn antitrust <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2018/01/27/qualcomm-is-fined-for-anti-competitive-practices-again">fine against Qualcomm</a>, a big chip designer.</p>
<h3>The state of the European Union</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">How will Europe <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/how-to-deal-with-europes-energy-crisis">get through winter</a> without the Russian gas it has previously relied on? On Wednesday Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president, proposed to raise €140bn ($140bn) through windfall taxes on energy companies to ease the burden of rising prices on households and businesses. During her annual “state of the union” address to the European Parliament Mrs von der Leyen said that it was “wrong” for companies to make record profits as a result of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The bloc is also discussing energy price caps and mandatory limits on electricity demand. Mrs von der Leyen called energy markets <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/europes-energy-market-was-not-built-for-this-crisis">unfit for purpose</a> as they allowed the high price of gas to drive up electricity costs. Energy ministers from the EU’s 27 member states will thrash out the details at a meeting on September 30th. The priority will be for Europe to present a united front, even as it faces recession.</p>
<h3>The great crypto merge</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In the early hours of Thursday morning a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/06/the-future-of-crypto-is-at-stake-in-ethereums-switch">major change</a> in the architecture of crypto will take place. Ethereum, the most important blockchain platform, will change the way it is run. Ethereum currently uses an energy-intensive mechanism called “proof-of-work” to verify transactions. But at around 4am GMT (equivalent to UCT, the benchmark time standard used by developers) it will “merge” with a new chain that uses “proof-of-stake”, a verification method that uses much less energy.<br/><br/> The environmental advantage is the most obvious reason for even those who take no interest in crypto to care about “the Merge”. But it is not the only one. The event is the first in a series of upgrades that should make Ethereum more efficient and scalable—and potentially more useful. That is assuming all goes smoothly, of course. Implementing the switch is like swapping the engine of a spaceship mid-flight. Time to find out if it can be done.</p>
