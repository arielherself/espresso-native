<p class="customisedFont">Two cities in <strong>China</strong> said that they would ease covid-19 restrictions amid the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows">continuing protests</a> against the country’s stringent measures. <strong>Chongqing</strong> in central China will loosen quarantine protocols, while <strong>Guangzhou</strong>, a southern city that saw clashes between protesters and police on Tuesday, also announced easing. Earlier authorities lifted a lockdown on Zhengzhou, home to the world’s biggest iPhone factory. But restrictions keep <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/28/chinas-economy-cannot-bear-much-more-zero-covid">pinching producers</a>; China’s manufacturing-sector contracted further in November.

The alliance reiterated its support for Ukrainian membership at a meeting for foreign ministers in Romania, but outlined no timeline for this. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials reported heavy Russian shelling in Kherson in the south, and difficult fighting further east in Luhansk and Kharkiv. </p>

<h3>Nancy Pelosi’s replacement</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday the Democratic Party in America’s House of Representatives, which <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/11/17/in-a-republican-house-investigations-and-fiscal-clashes-loom">lost its majority</a> at the midterms, chose new leaders. Nancy Pelosi, aged 82, has led the caucus with a steely grip for 19 years. Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn, who hold the number two and three posts, are 83 and 82 respectively. This <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/07/27/democrats-are-overdue-for-a-new-generation-of-leaders">octogenarian monopoly on power</a> has frustrated ambitious younger Democratic congressmen: ascending the ranks can mean waiting decades. In 2018, to placate them, Ms Pelosi agreed to cede the top job in 2022.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Her replacement will be Hakeem Jeffries. Aged 52, he is a pragmatic liberal in Ms Pelosi’s mould. Katherine Clark, 59, and Pete Aguilar, 43, will serve as deputies. This outcome—orchestrated by Ms Pelosi, who wanted an orderly transition—underlines the sway the outgoing speaker has over her colleagues. The Republicans, though, have been squabbling. Hardline conservatives are refusing to support <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/kevin-mccarthys-accidental-truthfulness/21808964">Kevin McCarthy</a>, the party’s newly-elected leader in the House—a preview of the fractiousness expected when Republicans control the chamber next year.</p>
<h3>China’s leaders seek to calm the protesters</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">After years of living under covid lockdowns—or with the threat of them—many people in China have had enough. Over the weekend tens of thousands took to the streets in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere, in an unprecedented <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/16/how-common-are-protests-in-china">wave of protests</a> expressing anger with the government. “We don’t want lockdowns, we want freedom,” they chanted.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The government will not grant the freedom of expression that many protesters want. But it hopes to calm some of the anger by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/28/chinas-economy-cannot-bear-much-more-zero-covid">loosening restrictions</a> without unleashing a wave of sickness that would cripple the country’s health system. On Tuesday the National Health Commission announced a plan to “accelerate the promotion of covid vaccines for the elderly”. So far only 66% of over-80s have received a booster shot, according to officials, although that is up from 40% earlier this month. That is a practical first step. But for the people who spent the weekend chanting “Down with Xi Jinping,” it may not be enough to mollify their rage.</p>
<h3>India’s economy cools but remains an outlier</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Few countries have enjoyed as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-indian-economy-remains-a-bright-spot-in-south-asia">smooth an economic recovery</a> from covid-19 as India. In the quarter ending in June, its annual growth surged to 13.5% (though it came from an especially low base, thanks to the impact of the pandemic in 2021). This resurgence is, in part, why the IMF predicts that India will ultimately grow 7% in 2022, to displace Britain as the world’s fifth-largest economy. Growth rates are now normalising somewhat. Data released on Wednesday revealed a much smaller year-on-year expansion of 6.3% for the quarter ending in September.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The global economic slowdown is hitting India’s exports; manufacturing activity remains sluggish. Interest-rate rises are also beginning to bite with tightening expected to continue until next year (albeit less aggressively). The cooling economy, however, may not be a bad thing. In addition to reining in inflation, currently at 6.8%, economists believe weaker domestic demand could reduce worrisome fiscal and trade deficits.</p>
<h3>Inflation may have peaked in the euro zone</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Much of Europe is shrouded in fog—and the outlook for inflation is similarly obscure. In America, inflation is slowly on the way down from its peak. In <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/03/even-recession-may-not-bring-down-europes-inflation">the euro zone</a>, that peak may have been reached in November. Wednesday’s flash release of the HICP—the bloc’s consumer-price index—shows inflation at 10%, down from 10.6% in October. The European Central Bank will now have to decide whether this slight decline in inflation is enough to slow down rate increases at its next meeting on December 15th.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The slight drop is because energy inflation fell from 41.5% compared with November 2021 to just 35%. Previous national inflation figures from Germany for November show that this is mostly because the price for car fuel and heating oil has dropped. Prices for gas and district heating are still rising, as it takes time for wholesale prices to reach final consumers. Underlying or “core” inflation, which excludes prices for energy and food and is a better gauge of future inflation pressure, remains stubbornly high. Even when the peak is clear, the way down looks foggy. </p>
<h3>Barbados starts work on a project to commemorate slavery</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday construction will begin on a Barbadian project to commemorate the British transatlantic slave trade. The Barbados Heritage District, designed by David Adjaye, a British-Ghanaian architect, will house a museum and research centre—as well as a memorial to the approximately 400,000 people trafficked to Barbados in the 1600s and 1700s. The complex is next to a site where some of their remains are buried. The first ground will be broken one year after the island ditched the British monarch as its head of state.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Attitudes towards culture, identity and the British monarchy are changing across the Caribbean. King Charles III is still head of state of seven countries in the region, but <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/09/09/some-of-the-new-kings-realms-may-become-republics">republican sentiment</a> is growing. Jamaica’s government wants the country to become a parliamentary republic. Smaller islands such as Antigua and Barbuda have said the same. The death of Queen Elizabeth II, who was hugely popular abroad as at home, may only hasten the separation.</p>
