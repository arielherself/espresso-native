The trip will mark the first time Mr Zelensky has left his country since Russia invaded in February. American lawmakers are preparing to pass a $1.7trn spending bill that contains $45bn in additional assistance to Ukraine and NATO. On Tuesday Mr Zelensky made a surprise visit to Bakhmut, a tiny town in eastern Ukraine that Russia has been<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut"> attempting to seize</a> for months.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Donald Trump </strong>paid $1.1m in federal income taxes during his first three years as president and nothing in 2020, when he reported large losses from his businesses, according to a summary of six years of his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2020/05/14/the-supreme-court-will-not-agree-on-the-presidents-taxes">tax returns</a>. The disclosure follows a lengthy legal battle by Democratic lawmakers to unseal the financial records that Mr Trump has shielded. The Supreme Court ruled in November that they could be released.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong> said that he will step down as CEO of <strong>Twitter</strong> as soon as he finds someone “foolish enough” to take the job. He had <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/12/19/elon-musks-44bn-education-on-free-speech">asked Twitter users</a> if he should stay. Of the 17m who responded, 57.5% said he should quit. Mr Musk, who has managed the firm controversially since he <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last">bought it</a> in October, said he will continue to run the company’s engineering teams.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Japan’s</strong> two-year sovereign bond yields bobbed above zero on Wednesday for the first time since 2015. The rise was prompted by a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/20/the-bank-of-japan-shocks-investors">surprising decision</a> on Tuesday by the country’s doveish central bank to lift its cap on ten-year bond yields, which caused the yen to surge. The move heralds a tighter monetary policy in the world’s third-largest economy—as well as the coming end of the global era of negative yields.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> said it would limit its official tally of <strong>covid-19 deaths</strong> to those who tested positive for the virus and died from respiratory failure. The definition is narrower than the previous standard, which included anyone who died after testing positive. As the virus spreads throughout the country, just five covid fatalities were reported on Tuesday; the true number is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/12/15/our-model-shows-that-chinas-covid-death-toll-could-be-massive">likely to be</a> far higher.</p>

The health secretary, Steve Barclay, said ambulance unions had made a “conscious choice” to harm patients. Despite contingency plans some emergency calls would go unanswered.

<h3>2022 in review: White-collar workers revisit the office</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the year in business. </em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">It was supposed to be the year that the world went back to the office. Perhaps even<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/12/07/china-is-loosening-its-covid-restrictions-at-great-risk"> in China</a>. By September 2022<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/08/the-world-is-almost-back-to-pre-covid-activity-levels"><em>The Economist’s</em> normalcy index</a> showed that most forms of activity were nearly back to their pre-pandemic normal. In richer countries, however, offices are stuck at around two-thirds of their pre-pandemic capacity, as they have been since late 2021. Many professionals seem to have settled into a<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/12/01/the-open-questions-of-hybrid-working"> hybrid arrangement</a> of some office days and some remote days.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There is much to recommend <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/12/14/and-the-word-of-2022-is">hybrid work</a>: flexibility for employees, periods of concentration at home, bursts of co-operation in the office. But managers, especially on Wall Street, have noted the downsides, too.<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/the-fight-over-the-hybrid-future-of-work"> A survey conducted by economists</a> a year ago found that firms expected around a quarter of all work hours to be spent at home in a post-covid world. That is about half what workers said they want; a compromise is still in the making.</p>
<h3>2022 in review: Multinationals rethink supply chains</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the year in business. </em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">Even as the year began, global businesses were growing weary under the weight of tangled supply chains.<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/01/29/why-supply-chain-problems-arent-going-away"> Shortages of staff and materials</a> were stoking inflation, as the after-effects of the pandemic rippled through the world economy. Then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring and reminded firms how quickly a political shock can close one market and wreak havoc in others. All this prompted the start of a<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/06/16/the-structure-of-the-worlds-supply-chains-is-changing"> structural transformation</a>. Firms and governments have begun to prioritise building supply chains that are robust, not just efficient.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The shift has another discernible direction: away from China. “The world’s factory”, an epithet often applied to China, is a designation that now makes some businesses nervous. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/23/new-research-spells-out-the-benefits-of-diverse-supply-chains">New research</a> spells out the benefits of more diverse supply chains. America and Europe have made the push geopolitical, too, by<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/07/29/america-takes-on-china-with-a-giant-microchips-bill"> boosting domestic chipmakers</a> to reduce their reliance on China in the name of national security. The new age of diversification might also herald an era of industrial policy.</p>
<h3>2022 in review: Big tech’s big reckoning</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the year in business. </em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">Having fattened themselves on the feast of 2021, the five largest tech firms started 2022 comprising over 20% of the S&amp;P 500 index.<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/02/04/metamorphosis-facebook-and-big-tech-competition"> Meta was first</a> among the MAAMA (Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple) to slip. Blindsided by TikTok’s incursion into social media, and then by Apple’s new privacy rules, Facebook’s parent came bearing bad news on February 2nd. The other giants’ investors glimpsed its shadow and turned tail. Suddenly the narrative of the 2010s—of natural monopolies enjoying an effortless dominance over the economy and investment portfolios—began to falter. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Over the summer <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/05/14/tech-bubbles-are-bursting-all-over-the-place">bubbles started popping</a>. By the fourth quarter Meta had shed 74% of its share price and<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/11/10/as-tech-lay-offs-spread-meta-sacks-11000-workers"> sacked 11,000 workers</a>. The total market capitalisation of MAAMA fell by $3.7trn. Still-private tech startups, having raised a stonking $621bn in 2021, were hit<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/06/28/the-great-silicon-valley-shake-out"> even harder</a>. And so, despite the spectre of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/03/big-tech-big-trouble">“conglomeritis”</a>, the biggest firms—those still fat enough to hibernate for the next few years—were the most hopeful about weathering the winter ahead.</p>
<h3>2022 in review: Elon Musk’s wild Twitter ride</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the year in business. </em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">The most stupendous (or at least stupefying) business story of the year started with a corporate takeover that at first nobody seemed to want and eventually nobody could stop watching. Back in April, Elon Musk was the richest man in the world, thanks to the public valuation of Tesla, his electric-car company. He hatched a plan to buy Twitter, a chitter-chattery social-media platform—not for pecuniary purposes, he said, but to save “free speech”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Having offered to buy at an<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/05/19/elon-musk-twitter-and-an-epic-case-of-buyers-remorse"> implied value of $44bn</a>, within a month Mr Musk changed his mind. But<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up"> Twitter’s board</a> kept him to his word, and by October he became its owner, reluctantly. And vengefully: he<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/11/10/as-tech-lay-offs-spread-meta-sacks-11000-workers"> halved the staff</a> overnight, scared away advertisers and generally turned the business upside-down. Innovations might have been welcome, but not like the $8 monthly blue “verified” tick that Mr Musk’s right-wing fan base cheered on. Free speech fared even worse. By December Mr Musk began expelling journalists from the site. And after Tesla’s shares tanked, he lost his place as the world’s richest person. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On December 18th Mr Musk asked Twitter users if he should step down as the platform’s CEO. After they voted “Yes”, he promised to find a replacement. Finding a new owner for the company however would be a real feat.</p>
