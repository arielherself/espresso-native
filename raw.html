Daily deliveries will drop to 20% of capacity, from the current 40%. Mr Zelensky called Russia a “terrorist state” for making the “life of every European worse”. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/how-gazprom-helps-the-kremlin-put-the-squeeze-on-europe/21807841">Gazprom</a> said the pipeline, which was shut recently for repairs, needs further work. Oil prices rose, on the expectation that Europeans may shift from gas to crude to cover their energy needs.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Walmart</strong> pared down its profit forecast for this year, sending shares in American retail firms for a spin. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2017/12/07/the-beast-of-bentonville-battles-amazon-the-king-of-the-e-commerce-jungle">beast of Bentonville</a> predicted its annual profits will decline by 11-13%, as food and fuel prices force consumers to reduce discretionary spending. Walmart’s shares promptly fell by 10% and Amazon’s fell by 4%. The S&amp;P 500’s Retail Index is down by 24% this year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Alibaba </strong>will apply to list in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, allowing investors from mainland China to buy shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant directly. The firm is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Chinese officials want companies to trade domestically. In January <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/29/the-battle-between-asias-financial-centres-is-heating-up">Hong Kong’s</a> stock exchange started permitting “innovative” Chinese companies to carry out dual listings. Daniel Zhang, Alibaba’s boss (successor to Jack Ma, a victim of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/can-chinese-big-tech-learn-to-love-big-brother/21809084">China’s crackdown </a>on big tech), said this would help attract a “more diversified investor base”.</p>

Ned Price pointed out that China has more influence over Myanmar than any other country, and urged all countries to refuse to sell Myanmar military equipment. China’s foreign ministry said that China did not interfere in other countries’ affairs. </p>

<h3>A darkening outlook for the global economy</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">An updated forecast for the global economy, due to be released by the IMF on Tuesday, will make for grim reading. The outlook has worsened steadily over the year, spoiled by Russia’s war in Ukraine, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/05/26/china-is-trying-to-protect-its-economy-from-western-pressure">economic weakness in China</a> and central banks’ struggle to choke off <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/26/why-inflation-looks-likely-to-stay-above-the-pre-pandemic-norm">inflation</a>.<br/><br/> The IMF last published its World Economic Outlook in April. Back then it revised down its forecast for world GDP growth in 2022 by nearly a full percentage point, to a so-so rate of 3.6%. But actual growth will almost certainly come in well below that forecast. Indeed, the updated projections may show that the world economy is on track for its third-worst performance of the millennium, after the covid-19 shock of 2020 and the financial crisis 2009. And there is plenty of time for the situation to worsen further.</p>
<h3>Keeping Europe warm this winter</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">An emergency meeting of EU energy ministers on Tuesday risks being unusually frosty. On the agenda is a plan for how the EU should cut gas demand so it can weather the winter, should Russia <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter">halt gas supplies</a>. Such fears were only deepened on Monday when Russia announced that it would further reduce the flow of gas to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, to 20% of capacity. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On July 20th the European Commission proposed that member-states should cut consumption by 15%, compared with the average for the past five years, from August 1st until the end of March. But some countries refuse to comply. Spain and Portugal wonder why they should be punished for the energy policies of countries, especially <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/07/14/can-deutschland-ag-cope-with-the-russian-gas-shock">Germany</a>, that spent decades making themselves ever-more dependent on Russian gas. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The likely outcome is a deal that keeps an EU-wide target but makes exemptions for some. Cosy relations must be maintained, for if negotiations fall apart the only winner would be Vladimir Putin. A collapse of European solidarity is exactly what he wants.</p>
<h3>Indonesia’s surprisingly energetic diplomacy</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For Xi Jinping, China’s president, a meeting with Joko Widodo on Tuesday marks something of a return to face-to-face diplomacy after his self-enforced isolation during the pandemic. (He did hold a few meetings with foreign leaders during Beijing’s Winter Olympics in February.) But for Jokowi, as Indonesia’s president is known, it is the latest in a recent flurry of visits.<br/><br/> Jokowi’s diplomacy has an important <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/07/21/why-indonesia-punches-below-its-weight-in-global-affairs">economic dimension</a>. He has pleaded with Vladimir Putin to unblock exports of Ukrainian wheat, which Indonesia needs for instant noodles. In Beijing he will lobby for a high-speed rail project. And investment will be top of the agenda when he heads to Japan and South Korea afterwards. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet Jokowi’s diplomatic skills will be especially tested by Indonesia’s hosting of a summit of G20 leaders in November. Russia is a G20 member, but the West has threatened to boycott the event if Mr Putin shows up. So Jokowi has invited Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, to join too, hoping that might soothe the West.</p>
<h3>Another false start in Stormont</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A fresh attempt to form a government in Northern Ireland has been postponed following the death of David Trimble, the unionist co-architect of the Good Friday Agreement. Rivals delayed recalling the devolved assembly as a mark of respect. The third attempt to restore power-sharing since May almost certainly would have failed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In February the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party brought down the administration in protest at the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/03/10/why-is-the-northern-ireland-protocol-so-contentious">Northern Ireland protocol</a>, a contentious part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that establishes <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/06/16/the-northern-ireland-protocol-enrages-some-businesses-pleases-others">a trading border</a> between Great Britain and Northern Ireland to avoid hardening the land border on the island of Ireland. The DUP went on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215">to lose</a> an election in May to Sinn Fein, its nationalist rival. But since then the DUP has repeatedly vetoed the formation of a new government.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The DUP hopes that Liz Truss, rather than Rishi Sunak, will win the Conservative Party leadership and stick to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/05/18/britain-and-the-eu-head-towards-a-showdown-over-the-northern-ireland-protocol">a Tory promise</a> to ditch most of the protocol. Either way, months of stasis loom.</p>
<h3>To the moon and back</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In 1969 Buzz Aldrin became the second Earthling to walk on the moon, stepping on to the lunar surface 19 minutes after his fellow American, Neil Armstrong. On Tuesday a sale at Sotheby’s in New York will auction memorabilia collected by Mr Aldrin from the mission. A jacket he wore on Apollo 11 has a guide price of $1m-$2m. So too does a broken circuit-breaker switch which nearly imperilled the mission, offered with the pen that Mr Aldrin used to fix it.<br/><br/> The sale is timely. A new <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/01/01/in-2022-a-moonrush-will-begin-in-earnest">moonrush</a> is under way as countries compete to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2021/07/17/america-china-and-the-race-to-the-moon">explore</a> Earth’s closest neighbour. China and Russia are building a joint moonbase. America’s Artemis programme aims to land on the far side of the moon, the first American mission to do so, by 2025. To take more astronauts to the moon, NASA is planning to use a rocket developed by Elon Musk’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/02/19/spacexs-monstrous-dirt-cheap-starship-may-transform-space-travel">SpaceX</a>, a company that wants to take billionaire tourists on off-world adventures. The astronomical costs of such trips make the items on offer in Mr Aldrin’s sale look reasonable.</p>
