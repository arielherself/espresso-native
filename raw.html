<p class="customisedFont">Russia has committed <strong>crimes against humanity</strong> in Ukraine, according to America’s government. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, an annual diplomatic event, Kamala Harris, America’s vice-president, called Russian actions “barbaric and inhumane” and promised that perpetrators would be held to account. In an earlier address Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, urged Western leaders to speed up weapons deliveries to his country</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea</strong> fired at least one <strong>ballistic missile</strong> into the Sea of Japan, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The move came a day after the North had threatened to retaliate after the South announced imminent military exercises with America. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many">Last year</a> saw America and South Korea hold their first full-scale joint exercises in five years, as well as myriad missile launches by the North.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">An Israeli diplomat was expelled from the opening ceremony of an <strong>African Union</strong> summit in Ethiopia, in a row about accreditation. Israel said that Sharon Bar-li, its deputy general for Africa, was an accredited observer, and that the AU had been “taken hostage by a small number of extremist countries such as Algeria and South Africa”. The AU said that Ms Bar-li had not been invited to be present.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> said it had successfully recovered all the sensors and debris from the suspected <strong>Chinese spy balloon</strong> it <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2023/02/07/the-lessons-from-the-chinese-spy-balloon">shot down</a> earlier this month. Officials will now analyse the “guts” of the recovered objects. However, the search for three other unidentified objects shot down this month was called off as investigators had “discovered no debris”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Militants stormed a police station in Karachi, <strong>Pakistan’s </strong>biggest city, killing at least four people. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2023/01/05/pakistan-and-china-find-they-have-little-leverage-with-the-taliban">Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan</a> took responsibility for the attack.

A spokesperson declined to confirm the bid’s value, but the team’s owners, the Glazer family, are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/01/19/football-clubs-revenues-rebound-from-covid-especially-in-england">asking for around £5bn ($6bn)</a>. The nonbinding, debt-free offer by Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Jaber al-Thani follows only one other public bid, from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, a British billionaire.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The five former police officers in Memphis, Tennessee, accused of second-degree murder in the death of <strong>Tyre Nichols</strong> pled not guilty. They also face charges of aggravated assault and official misconduct, among others, and are out on bail. They stopped Nichols’s car and beat him on January 7th; he <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2023/02/01/why-holding-bad-police-officers-to-account-is-so-difficult">died in hospital</a> three days later, prompting nationwide protests.

<h3>The Republicans’ new cash cow</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">This weekend in balmy Key Biscayne, Florida, a fundraising frenzy is under way. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which funnels money to Republican candidates running for America’s House of Representatives, is hosting its winter retreat there. Deep-pocketed donors will enjoy golf, catamaran sailing and access to the Republican Party’s leaders. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Since leaving office Donald Trump has headlined several NRCC fundraisers. Yet his war chest for a 2024 presidential re-election bid, announced in November, remains small—a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/01/fundraising-remains-predictive-of-success-in-congressional-elections">reflection</a> of his waning popularity. He reported a meagre $9.5m haul in the first six weeks of his campaign. (By contrast, he raised $250m between November 2020, when he lost the election, and the Capitol insurrection on January 6th 2021.) Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor and Mr Trump’s likely <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/12/20/donald-trump-is-losing-ground-to-ron-desantis-ahead-of-2024">chief competitor</a>, raised a staggering $200m in his gubernatorial race last year. He is the one set to get top billing at big fundraising events in Texas and California in the coming weeks. The money raised will go to county parties—but they will put him in front of major donors who might eventually bankroll him to the White House.</p>
<h3>The search to improve vaccines</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Messenger RNA vaccines, such as those for covid-19, have proved to be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2021/03/27/covid-19-vaccines-have-alerted-the-world-to-the-power-of-rna-therapies">powerful tools</a> in responding to new diseases. They are highly effective, quick to develop and adaptable. Because the technology uses just part of the genetic sequence of the pathogen, they do not require growing large quantities of it in the laboratory. But there is a catch: the vaccines are extremely sensitive to heat. Maintaining them at the necessary <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/16/vaccines-based-on-mrna-need-to-get-out-of-the-freezer">freezing temperatures</a> is difficult, especially in poor and remote regions. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But efforts to improve their thermostability are well under way. One seemingly successful approach replaces the lipid nanoparticles that protect the mRNA with long chains of lab-made molecules, while another delivers a dry vaccine via patches armed with tiny needles. Both approaches remove the need for freezing, making stockpiling easier. These ideas are still in the early stages of development but could play an important role in preparing for future diseases.</p>
<h3>And the award goes to…</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The biggest winner at the 76th British Academy Film Awards on Sunday is likely to be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/the-best-films-of-2022">“The Banshees of Inisherin”</a>. Martin McDonagh’s grisly black comedy has ten nominations in nine categories; both Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan are up for best supporting actor. Charlotte Wells’s wistful indie drama, “Aftersun”, is the clear frontrunner for outstanding British debut. Otherwise, there are no safe bets. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">“All Quiet on the Western Front”, Netflix’s German anti-war epic, surprised pundits by getting the most nominations, 14 in total, but it probably will not win the most prizes. Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis”, Todd Field’s “Tár”, and a psychedelic, universe-hopping adventure, “Everything Everywhere All At Once”, are all strong contenders in multiple categories. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">With so many results hard to predict, BAFTA-watchers will be on the edge of their seats. So will Oscars-watchers: success at Britain’s flagship film-awards ceremony helps a movie’s chances in America’s contest, too.</p>
<h3>Sand and speed at the Daytona 500</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Daytona Beach, north-east of Orlando, Florida, has been synonymous with speed for more than a century. Automobile manufacturers and drivers decamped there from Europe in the 1920s and subsequently set 15 land-speed records. Since 1959 it has been home to the biggest <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2012/02/25/nascars-ride-gets-bumpy">stock-car race</a>, the Daytona 500. This year’s edition takes place on Sunday. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Those emerging from several days of qualifying must complete 200 laps of the 2.5-mile-long oval course in the fastest possible time. The record has stood for a scarcely believable 43 years, when Buddy Baker clocked an average speed of 177.6mph across two hours and 48 minutes of racing, leading for 143 laps. The 100,000 fans thronging this year’s event will be hoping for a more exciting contest, such as that in 2016, when Danny Hamlin beat Martin Truex Jr by 0.011 seconds, the closest-ever finish. The presence of seven previous winners on the start line augurs another nail-biter.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Peter Obi, the man shaking up Nigeria’s presidential race</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“What do I offer you: coffee, tea, water?” asks Peter Obi, the minor-party candidate leading the polls to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/14/can-a-political-underdog-save-nigeria">become Nigeria’s president</a>. Such hospitality is de rigueur among African politicians. But usually the Big Man barks out an order; a flunky proffers the drinks. With Mr Obi, things are different. He fetches tea for your correspondent himself and asks, “Do you need honey?”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In the egotistical world of Nigerian politics, Mr Obi’s humility is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2023/02/12/on-the-trail-with-the-surprise-front-runner-in-nigerias-presidential-race">refreshing</a>. The army of young supporters hoping to see him <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/09/after-eight-dismal-years-nigeria-prepares-to-replace-president-buhari">elected on February 25th</a>, dubbed “Obidients”, delight in the fact that he often flies economy class, carries his own suitcases and claims to own just two pairs of shoes. They view Mr Obi, aged 61, as a sprightly outsider <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/13/peter-obi-a-man-who-carries-his-own-suitcases-could-be-nigerias-next-president" data-tegid="78486thsc95efl0gsshmaprvs8lknlnb">shaking up Nigeria’s venal, sclerotic political class</a>. By contrast, the two big parties’ candidates—Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar—are in their 70s. America’s government has accused both of corruption (and both deny wrongdoing).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In fact, Mr Obi is no political neophyte, having served two terms as governor of his home state, Anambra, in the south-east. He then stood as Mr Abubakar’s vice-presidential candidate in 2019. Before entering politics he worked as a trader and banker, becoming wealthy—unlike lots of Nigerian politicians—before holding office. But he, too, has faced questions about his finances. He appeared in the Pandora Papers, a leak of the records of financial companies, for owning an undeclared offshore company. He insists there was no deliberate wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The pragmatic Mr Obi seems above all to be selling <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2023/02/15/peter-obi-on-why-he-is-running-to-be-nigerias-president">competence</a>. In conversation he refers to the Human Development Index and the money supply. As governor he left a fiscal surplus to his successor—a rarity. His economic instincts appear to be liberal. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Rival campaigns scoff that Obidients are a paper army that is only influential on Twitter. Many pundits concur. At the previous presidential election the candidate from his Labour Party won just 5,074 votes out of nearly 29m cast. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Still, Mr Obi has energised young, urban voters across Nigeria’s main divisions of geography, ethnicity and religion. (The country is divided between a largely Christian south and Muslim north; Mr Obi is Christian.) By making this election about competence, character and perhaps even ideas, he promises to upset the old electoral calculus based on horse-trading. When asked what distinguishes him most from the other two major candidates Mr Obi replies: “Who can people trust?”</p>
