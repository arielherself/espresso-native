<p class="customisedFont">Jeremy Hunt, <strong>Britain’s</strong> new chancellor of the exchequer, reversed almost all the remaining tax measures made in his predecessor’s “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically">mini-budget</a>” three weeks ago. The basic rate of tax will remain at 20% indefinitely and the scope of a cap on the price of energy will now be reviewed next April. Mr Hunt went further with this U-turn than even the markets had been expecting. The <strong>pound </strong>rose on the news. These measures signal the end of the prime minister’s signature economic policies, leaving Liz Truss in a perilous political position.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russian forces </strong>sent Iranian-made drones raining down on <strong>central Kyiv</strong>, one week after the start of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/13/russias-terror-strikes-fail-to-do-much-damage-to-ukraine">a barrage</a> intended as revenge against a Ukrainian attack on the bridge spanning the Kerch strait. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said that one woman had been killed and three people hospitalised. Intense fighting has been reported in the city of Bakhmut, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/18/where-next-for-ukraines-army">in Donetsk</a>, where Russian forces have continued to make advances.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">China’s National Bureau of Statistics amended its calendar to suggest it will not publish key economic data, including GDP growth, on Tuesday as expected. The release, which is expected to have shown the continued impact of the country’s zero-covid strategy, would have come at a sensitive time during the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/10/13/the-communist-party-congress-will-highlight-xi-jinpings-power">Communist Party congress</a>. On Sunday China’s president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> defended that painful policy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">David Solomon, the head of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, is set to announce a major restructuring that will consolidate the bank into three main divisions. The asset and wealth management businesses will combine, as will the trading and investment teams. The bank’s unprofitable consumer unit will be broken-up, creating a standalone subsection dealing with corporate partners. These changes mark the company’s third reorganisation in four years, and a retreat from Mr Solomon’s signature project of expanding into direct-to-consumer banking.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The<strong> Swedish parliament</strong> voted for Moderate Party leader <strong>Ulf Kristersson</strong> to become their next prime minister. He will lead a right-wing bloc supported by the Sweden Democrats, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/demonising-nationalist-parties-has-not-stemmed-their-rise-in-europe">populist party</a>. While the far-right party will not have any seats in cabinet, they have negotiated major changes in government policy, including a cut to Sweden’s refugee quota. Their leader Jimmie Akesson declared this deal a “paradigm shift” on immigration.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Japan’s </strong>prime minister, Kishida Fumio, ordered an official inquiry into the <strong>Unification Church</strong>, a cult-like religious group. The group attracted <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/07/19/what-drove-yamagami-tetsuya-to-kill-abe-shinzo">scrutiny</a> after the assasination of former prime minister Abe Shinzo. The family of the man accused of killing him was linked to the church, and it was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/09/26/the-fallout-from-abe-shinzos-murder-could-unseat-his-successor">later revealed</a> that almost half of Mr Abe’s and Mr Kishida’s Liberal Democratic Party had some contact with it as well.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Nigeria’s </strong>government said more than 600 people have been killed by <strong>flooding </strong>in three-quarters of the country’s states. More than 1m people have been displaced. Nigeria <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/01/every-year-heavy-rain-brings-misery-and-gridlock-to-west-africa">often experiences autumn floods</a>, but this year the effects have been exacerbated by unusually heavy rain and climate change, as well as state governments’ failure to prepare adequately, according to the country’s minister of humanitarian affairs.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 31, the number of days served by Britain’s shortest-serving chancellor, Iain Macleod—eight fewer than Kwasi Kwarteng, who was sacked last week. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/14/kwasi-kwartengs-tenure-as-britains-chancellor-wasnt-the-shortest">Read the full article</a>.</p>

<h3>NATO’s not-so-routine nuclear drills</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday NATO begins its annual nuclear drills, Steadfast Noon. The exercises, hosted by Belgium and postponed from earlier this year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, include 14 of the alliance’s 30 members. There will be no live warheads, but the manoeuvres include jets that can carry nuclear bombs. NATO’s secretary general, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/02/09/jens-stoltenberg-explains-how-to-step-back-from-the-brink-of-european-conflict">Jens Stoltenberg</a>, has called the operation “routine training” designed to keep the deterrent “safe, secure and effective”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the war in Ukraine means that the drills will be far from business as usual. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has made<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-vows-to-send-more-invaders-the-west-should-arm-ukraine-faster"> transparent threats</a> to use nuclear weapons amid his faltering invasion. The head of GCHQ, Britain’s spy agency, said last week that there were no signs of an imminent attack, but fears of<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear"> escalation are real</a>. NATO expects that Russia will soon hold its own nuclear exercise, dubbed Grom.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The alliance is betting that conducting its nuclear drills helps keep its deterrent potent. Mr Stoltenberg says that avoiding escalation requires “firm, predictable behaviour”. Observers will hope he is right.</p>
<h3>Jeremy Hunt takes the wheel</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A fortnight ago, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2018/04/05/jeremy-hunt-the-great-survivor">Jeremy Hunt</a>’s career in high office appeared to be at an end. An affable and fastidious former foreign secretary, he had twice run to be leader of the Conservative Party, without success. Now he is the most powerful man in Britain. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday morning Mr Hunt undid almost all of the tax measures announced by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng in his “mini-budget” on September 23rd. The basic rate of tax will remain at 20% indefinitely and the scope of a cap on the price of energy will now be reviewed next April. Measures which have already begun the process of legislation, including a cut to the National Insurance payroll tax, will remain.<br/><br/> Mr Hunt has been tasked with clawing back the trust of bond markets after the market meltdown that followed Mr Kwarteng’s “mini-budget”. With Mr Hunt in the driving seat, Ms Truss is now <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/10/14/liz-truss-has-lost-her-chancellor-signature-tax-cut-and-authority">prime minister in name only</a>. Conservative MPs are clamouring to force her from office. Westminster this week will be a vipers’ nest.</p>
<h3>Chinese cars plug into European markets</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Sceptical of splurging marketing budgets on fancy stands in vast exhibition centres, few of the world’s carmakers will congregate in Paris for the first motor show in the city since 2018, which opens on Monday. Flying the tricolore will be France’s Renault and Peugeot, the latter of which joins other brands owned by Stellantis. More notable will be the appearance of BYD and Great Wall Motors, two <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/13/chinese-marques-try-to-make-inroads-into-western-markets">Chinese brands</a> that will use the event to flaunt electric cars they hope will break into the European market.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">China, home to the world’s biggest car industry, also churns out more<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/04/09/save-globalisation-buy-a-chinese-ev"> electric vehicles</a> than any other country. Several of its makers have Europe in their sights. Nio, a Tesla wannabe, recently showed off three electric models in Berlin that will soon be more widely available on the continent. Already nearly one in 20 EVs sold in Europe is Chinese. Europe’s carmakers, already struggling with the fallout from the pandemic and the transition to electrification, face one more problem.</p>
<h3>India’s oldest party seeks a revamp</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday members of the Congress, India’s main opposition party, will vote for a new president. For the first time in nearly 25 years the new boss will be someone outside of the Gandhi clan, which has long run the party as a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2021/11/27/for-indias-opposition-to-recover-the-gandhis-should-quit">family business</a>. The choice is between Shashi Tharoor, a smooth-talking diplomat-turned-politician, and Mallikarjun Kharge, an 80-year-old party veteran and Gandhi-family stooge.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Tharoor believes that fresh, non-dynastic leadership can revitalise India’s grand old party. With a general election less than two years away, the Congress desperately needs it. In the past two elections the party has been swept aside by the ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. In 2019 the BJP took nearly double the Congress’s share of the vote.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Mr Tharoor’s hopes may be in vain. The build-up to the Congress’s leadership election has featured the same <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/10/06/indias-congress-party-seems-determined-to-prove-its-critics-right">ineptitude and in-fighting</a> that have dogged the party for years. More importantly, the Gandhi family is unlikely to cede control. Mr Kharge is expected to win comfortably.</p>
<h3>The six Booker hopefuls</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Booker prize briefly turns literature into hot news. The most coveted honour in English-language fiction, to be awarded on Monday night, makes six titles glow with the heat of incendiary headlines. In “Glory”, NoViolet Bulawayo’s talking animals stage a political parable of her <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/09/07/robert-mugabe-leaves-a-bitter-legacy">unhappy homeland</a>, Zimbabwe. Percival Everett’s “The Trees” blends mystery, horror and elegy as it unearths <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2019/11/14/memories-of-emmett-till">racist atrocities</a> in the American South. Shehan Karunatilaka’s “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/08/18/shehan-karunatilaka-returns-with-another-thrilling-satire">The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida</a>”, an incandescent tragicomic story narrated by a ghost, torches corruption and injustice in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Quietly and succinctly—at 116 pages, hers is the shortest book ever shortlisted— Claire Keegan burns through rural <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/christmas-specials/2019/12/18/the-liberalisation-of-ireland">Ireland’s abusive secrets</a> in “Small Things Like These”. Alan Garner, a veteran fabulist, unites northern English folklore with quantum physics in “Treacle Walker”; and “Oh William!’ is the third instalment in a lauded family saga by Elizabeth Strout, an American author. Her book is popular with bookworms and bookies alike. For sheer prose chutzpah, Mr Karunatilaka should take the gong. But “Glory” might live up to its name.</p>
