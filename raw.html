<h3>A sombre Singles’ Day in China</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“Singles’ Day”, an informal holiday in China that falls on Friday, began as a celebration of those unlucky in love (the date, 11/11, symbolises four single people). Then, over a decade ago Alibaba, an e-commerce giant, helped turn the day into a shopping event. Today most online retailers in China offer sales during the festival and millions of Chinese people splurge on e-commerce websites. But this year the world’s biggest online shopping day will probably be smaller than in 2021.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Harsh covid restrictions in China have <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/06/09/it-will-take-time-for-chinas-consumers-to-recover-from-lockdown">dampened consumer sentiment</a>. For the first time in 14 years the value of Alibaba’s sales on Singles’ Day may fall, from a record 540bn yuan (then $85bn) last year to 532bn yuan, according to estimates from Bloomberg. Sporadic lockdowns across the country may even disrupt the logistics networks needed to deliver the goods. Most countries have learned to live with covid. China is doing anything but. </p>
<h3>The carbon budget crunch</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2.9trn tonnes of carbon dioxide is the most that can accumulate in the atmosphere for there to be a reasonable chance of avoiding temperature rises beyond 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The “budget” for 2°C is 3.7trn tonnes. By 2019 around 2.4trn tonnes had already been released. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday the Global Carbon Project, a scientific consortium, released its annual report on carbon emissions and how much the world has left to “spend”. Its calculation is depressing. This year global emissions rose by 1% compared with 2021, to their highest-ever level. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">There are now just 380bn tonnes of carbon dioxide left in the bank for 1.5°C, or 1.2trn tonnes for 2°C: equivalent to nine and 30 years’ emissions, respectively, at current rates. This should galvanise negotiators gathered in Egypt for COP27, the UN’s climate summit. They must move to slash emissions now, rather than promise to cut them in the future. And they must start thinking seriously about what to do when <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/11/05/the-world-is-going-to-miss-the-totemic-1-5c-climate-target">the budget runs out</a>.</p>
<h3>Visions of a new world at the Paris Peace Forum</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Many Ukrainians mistrust France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, because until recently he has persisted in talking overtly to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. But in a speech at the UN in September, Mr Macron explained that his desire for dialogue was part of a search for a new multilateral global order. On Friday he will expound on that vision at the Paris Peace Forum, an annual talking shop in the French capital.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There will, inevitably, be much discussion about how to bring the war in Ukraine to an end. But the forum—slogan: “Riding out the multi-crisis”—will place the conflict alongside other problems such as climate change, food security, covid-19 and internet governance. This is reflected in its list of speakers and panellists, which includes big names from Africa, such as Umaro Sissoco Embaló, the president of Guinea-Bissau, and Asia, such as Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singaporean diplomat. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/international/2022/10/24/vladimir-putin-is-dragging-the-world-back-to-a-bloodier-time">Mr Putin</a> also likes to talk about a new multipolar world. The version that will be presented in Paris seems more benign.</p>
<h3>Latin America searches for a development banker</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Nominations close on Friday for one of Latin America’s top jobs. The Inter-American Development Bank lends about $14bn a year <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/special-report/2022/06/16/a-region-that-seems-unable-to-reach-its-potential">in the region</a>, and advises governments on projects and reforms. In 2020 Donald Trump’s administration defied a convention that the bank’s president should be Latin American and cajoled enough votes to install Mauricio Claver-Carone, an official from America’s National Security Council. Mr Claver-Carone promised improvements, but alienated many shareholders. In September the board sacked him for having an affair with his chief-of-staff, whose salary he had raised (he denies the allegations). <br/><br/> This time Latin America’s governments have put forward strong local candidates. Brazil and Mexico have proposed their central bankers (Ilan Goldfajn and Gerardo Esquivel, respectively). Chile’s candidate is Nicolás Eyzaguirre, a former finance minister. Sergio Massa, Argentina’s economy minister, is keen, though he would struggle to leave his current post given what he calls his country’s “critical” economic situation. Much horse-trading may lie ahead before the board chooses the new president on November 20th.</p>
<h3>Storytelling amid censorship in Iran</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In October a fire engulfed Evin, Iran’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/18/irans-protests-spread-as-a-notorious-prison-burns">most notorious prison</a>. The blaze threatened the lives of thousands of inmates, including one of the country’s most prominent directors. Jafar Panahi—who in 2010 was accused of “propaganda against the system” and forbidden from making films or leaving Iran—is one of many film-makers the regime has trapped through house arrests, travel bans or imprisonment. He continued to create and made the internationally acclaimed “Taxi” (2015) and “3 Faces” (2018). In July Mr Panahi was sentenced to six years’ behind bars.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">His latest film, “No Bears”, shot in secret before his arrest and released in British cinemas on Friday, draws on his own trials to produce a deft (and surprisingly funny) meta-narrative. Mr Panahi plays himself in this film-about-a-film, which is set either side of Iran’s border with Turkey. By blurring the line between fact and fiction, “No Bears” offers a moving portrait of what it is like to live, and make art, in the face of repression.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
