<h3>Who can regulate federal elections in America?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/09/29/what-to-expect-from-the-new-scotus-term">Supreme Court</a> considers a novel idea that could upend the way America conducts elections. According to proponents of the controversial “independent state legislature theory”, state lawmakers should have near-absolute authority (limited only by Congress) to regulate federal elections—from drawing districts to setting voting hours. Currently state courts can weigh in on, and block, such rules.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>Moore v Harper </em>arises from a struggle over a strikingly gerrymandered congressional map drawn by Republicans in North Carolina in 2021. When the state’s top court ruled that the map violated North Carolina’s constitution, Republican state lawmakers asked the Supreme Court to step in. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">They contend that the federal constitution empowers only state legislatures to regulate elections for Congress, with no role for state courts. Democratic state officials and voting-rights groups dismiss this position as “an intolerable affront” to federalism. It “clashes irreconcilably”, they say, with “principles on which our republic was built”.</p>
<h3>The EU’s economy starts to shiver</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Could Vladimir Putin’s efforts to hurt the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/24/europe-faces-an-enduring-crisis-of-energy-and-geopolitics">European economy</a> soon start to bite? Wednesday’s release of detailed GDP figures revised the EU’s growth in the third quarter of 2022 upwards to 0.3%, compared with the second quarter. Not great, but no recession either. Most of the growth came from investment, as businesses and households upgraded their kit to prepare for higher energy costs.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But that boost may not last. Incoming data point to a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/11/as-europe-falls-into-recession-russia-climbs-out">looming recession</a>. Retail sales in October were down; sentiment indicators for manufacturing and construction remain depressed. Most worrying, the whole services sector is weakening, with the steepest fall in activity since February 2021.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The one bright spot is the labour market. Businesses expect to hire more workers and unemployment remains very low. That, at least, sends a positive signal: the EU’s economy may be frail, but businesses seem to not expect that weakness to last.</p>
<h3>Britain’s workforce has fallen ill</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A report released on Wednesday by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a think-tank, makes worrying reading. Britain is the only G7 country whose labour force has not yet returned to its pre-pandemic size. Some 2.5m Britons in its 36m workforce are economically inactive because of illness. And those in work are getting sicker: workers are 13% more likely to have a health condition than they were three years ago.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This bodes ill for Britain’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/06/09/britains-productivity-problem-is-long-standing-and-getting-worse">chronically unproductive economy</a>: regions with higher rates of sickness tend to have lower productivity. And blue-collar workers were more likely to miss work, exacerbating economic inequalities that have only become more entrenched during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">To heal the economy, the IPPR recommends that policymakers improve prevention of avoidable illnesses and push for quicker access to doctors and treatments. Workplaces should also be more accommodating to those with poor health. Britain’s ailing economy can scarcely afford a sickly workforce.</p>
<h3>How to save the Earth’s biodiversity</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">COP15, the UN’s 15th summit on biodiversity, begins in Montreal on Wednesday. More than 20,000 delegates will spend a fortnight debating how to save Earth’s plant and animal species, over 12% of which are at risk of extinction.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/technology-quarterly/2021/06/15/loss-of-biodiversity-poses-as-great-a-risk-to-humanity-as-climate-change">Healthy ecosystems</a> provide food, building materials and medicines. Plants release oxygen and absorb about 11bn tonnes of carbon dioxide each year; the oceans another 10bn. (Humans emit about 50bn tonnes.) The World Bank estimates that ecosystem degradation will reduce<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/02/06/how-should-economists-think-about-biodiversity"> global GDP</a> by $225bn by 2030.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">All of the UN’s previous biodiversity targets were missed. The hope is that COP15 will yield a stronger set of measurable, legally binding rules, as the Paris agreement did for climate change. Many countries want a commitment to protect 30% of the world’s land and oceans by 2030 (and money to do it). But how to get there remains opaque—especially when America remains one of the few countries not to have ratified COP’s underlying Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<h3>Britain crowns a contemporary artist</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Over the past 40 years the Turner prize has been called many things: self-absorbed, embarrassing, baffling and irrelevant, to name but a few. But that won’t stop the art world from waiting impatiently for the announcement on Wednesday evening of the winner of Britain’s most prominent contemporary-art award.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This year’s final four include no men and no artists’ collectives (<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2021/12/02/array-collective-a-group-from-belfast-wins-the-turner-prize">in contrast with the situation in 2021</a>, when only groups were shortlisted). Two of this year’s finalists —Ingrid Pollard and Veronica Ryan—are black British artists with long careers exploring historic racism and the lasting effects of colonisation. The others—Heather Phillipson and Sin Wai Kin—are younger, and their concerns have more recent origins. These include the dynamics of boy bands, the future of the planet and gender identity.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Pollard’s work, which explores Britain’s racist past through pub signs and puppetry, deserves the prize. But the Turner is nothing if not contrary. Sin Wai Kin’s pop-culture pastiche films could come out top.</p>
