<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>OPEC+</strong>, a group of petroleum-exporting countries and their allies, including Russia, agreed to slash their output quota for oil by 2m barrels per day, equivalent to 2% global supply. It is the biggest cut since 2020. Meanwhile, EU ambassadors agreed to a price cap on <strong>Russian oil</strong> to punish Mr Putin for his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear">nuclear threats</a> and the war in Ukraine. The bloc has been trying to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Vladimir Putin, <strong>Russia’s</strong> president, ratified the annexation of four Ukrainian regions under Russian law, even as Ukrainian forces continue to retake territory.

Simone Tebet, a centre-right senator, won 4% in Sunday’s poll. She said Jair Bolsonaro, the hard-right incumbent who got 43%, had brought “hate and strife” to Brazil. He will face Lula in a run-off on October 30th.</p>

While acknowledging her government’s U-turn on its plan to scrap the top rate of income tax, Ms Truss vowed to continue with other parts of the “mini-budget” that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/27/the-fallout-from-kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-continues">unsettled markets</a> in September.

<h3>Picking up the bill for Ian</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Natural disasters force politicians of all stripes to spend big. Cue the about-face of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2021/07/24/the-rise-of-ron-desantis">Ron DeSantis</a>, Florida’s Republican governor. In 2013 Mr DeSantis voted against a federal relief package after Hurricane Sandy walloped the Democratic-run states of New Jersey and New York. But now, amid the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida">wreckage of Hurricane Ian</a>, he needs all the federal aid he can get. Around 100 Floridians have died and insured losses could reach $57bn, making Ian the second-costliest hurricane in American history, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. So Mr DeSantis will have to play nice with President Joe Biden when he visits Florida on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Hurricanes are getting more expensive, owing to population growth and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/is-climate-change-making-hurricanes-worse">increased severity</a> from climate change. The federal government pays 70% of disaster relief, from flood-insurance claims to road repairs. But that is just the initial cost. Welfare transfers, such as unemployment and medical benefits, to hurricane-hit counties can far surpass immediate disaster payments. </p>
<h3>Russia on the back foot in Kherson</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine’s army continues to make <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame">stunning progress</a>. In the eastern Donetsk region, last week it retook Lyman, a transport hub on strategic high ground; and in the neighbouring Luhansk region it is bearing down on weak Russian defensive lines near the towns of Kreminna and Svatove. So soon after Russia’s cynical attempt to formalise its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/27/vladimir-putin-stages-four-fake-referendums-in-occupied-ukraine">theft</a> of Donetsk and Luhansk and two other provinces, the losses are embarrassing for Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Now, in the southern province of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter">Kherson</a>, Ukraine is mounting an offensive of greater significance. Russia’s occupation of the region in the early weeks of the war gave it a land bridge to Crimea, a peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014. Ukrainian forces are moving rapidly along the west bank of the Dnieper river. After Ukrainian troops made a 20km push towards the town of Dudchany, Russian troops, fearing encirclement, fell back to more defensible positions. With morale and supply lines under pressure, it may be only the start of a more general retreat.</p>
<h3>Tightening the world’s oil spigots</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">OPEC, which controls almost a third of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/08/25/could-the-demonised-oil-industry-become-a-force-for-decarbonisation">world oil output</a>, has agreed to the biggest monthly cut to production targets since the start of the pandemic in 2020. The cartel’s members and allies, including Russia, decided to slash the target by 2m barrels per day, or roughly 2% of global supplies, at a summit in Vienna on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The group is worried about falling demand. Expensive energy has led to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/03/the-g7-plans-to-cap-russian-oil-prices">cuts in consumption</a>. China’s covid and property woes, and rising interest rates around the world, augur global recession. And the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/why-the-dollar-is-strong-and-why-that-is-a-problem">strong dollar</a>, in which oil prices are denominated, makes the black stuff harder to afford outside of America.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The actual <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/three-big-uncertainties-cloud-the-oil-market/21808307">supply of oil</a> is likely to decline by much less than the target reduction suggests. This is because most OPEC oil producers already pump less oil than their quotas allow them to. But markets still reckon it will make a difference: since late September, when rumours of cuts began swirling, the price of oil jumped by about 10%.</p>
<h3>Voting rights in America</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Twice in the past decade the Supreme Court has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2021/07/01/the-supreme-court-takes-another-bite-out-of-the-voting-rights-act">weakened the Voting Rights Act</a>, a law passed in 1965 to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/06/12/how-the-voting-rights-act-limits-gerrymanders">tackle racial discrimination</a> in America’s elections. On Tuesday the justices heard oral arguments in a case that could take a third bite out of the landmark civil-rights statute.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>Merrill v Milligan</em> asks whether Alabama’s congressional map is racially discriminatory. About 27% of Alabamians are black, but only one of the state’s seven House districts is home to a majority of black residents. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether a lower court was right to tell Alabama’s legislature to redraw the map with a second majority-black district.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The six conservative justices seem averse to race-conscious measures combatting discrimination. But Ketanji Brown Jackson, the newest justice, led a spirited defence of the lower court’s move. The framers designed the 14th Amendment, she said, to “make people who had less opportunity…equal to white citizens”. A decision is expected next year.</p>
<h3>Mr Bond, Amazon has been expecting you</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For 60 years the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/09/22/sixty-years-ago-james-bond-and-the-beatles-made-debuts">super-spy</a> has entertained cinema audiences. On Wednesday all 25 James Bond films, from “Dr No” (1962) to “No Time to Die” (2021), were made available to watch at home too, on Amazon’s Prime Video <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/the-video-streaming-battle-is-going-global">streaming service</a>. But fans—and Amazon executives—wonder how long they will have to wait for the next instalment.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Amazon won the rights to Bond in March with its $8.5bn acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), the 98-year-old studio behind the movies. Prime Video needs fresh content and Amazon hopes to milk the Bond franchise for sequels and spin-offs. But creative control lies with the descendants of Bond’s first producer, Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, and they seem to be in no hurry to make the next movie. After Daniel Craig quit the role, no actor has been chosen as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2021/10/15/good-evening-ms-bond-weve-been-expecting-you">his replacement</a>, making a new film unlikely before 2025. Amazon will need to wait for its troubleshooter a little longer.</p>
