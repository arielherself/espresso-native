<p class="customisedFont">Russia has committed <strong>crimes against humanity</strong> in Ukraine, according to America’s government. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, an annual diplomatic event, Kamala Harris, America’s vice-president, called Russian actions “barbaric and inhumane” and promised that perpetrators would be held to account. In an earlier address Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, urged Western leaders to speed up weapons deliveries to his country</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> said it had successfully recovered all the sensors and debris from the suspected <strong>Chinese spy balloon</strong> it <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2023/02/07/the-lessons-from-the-chinese-spy-balloon">shot down</a> earlier this month. Officials will now analyse the “guts” of the recovered objects. However, the search for three other unidentified objects shot down this month was called off as investigators had “discovered no debris”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>North Korea</strong> fired at least one <strong>ballistic missile</strong> into the Sea of Japan, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The move came a day after the North had threatened to retaliate after the South announced imminent military exercises with America. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many">Last year</a> saw America and South Korea hold their first full-scale joint exercises in five years, as well as myriad missile launches by the North.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>EDF</strong>, the French energy giant, reported its largest ever annual losses of €17.9bn ($19.1bn) in 2022. Financial debt rose by 50% to €64.5bn. It was a bruising year: the government forced the state-controlled company to cap prices to protect households and businesses, while scheduled repairs <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/frances-nuclear-plants-are-going-down-for-repairs">shut down</a> more than half of the country’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/12/12/can-the-french-nuclear-industry-avoid-meltdown">nuclear reactors</a>.</p>

The nonbinding, debt-free offer by Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Jaber al-Thani follows only one other public bid, from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, a British billionaire.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The five former police officers in Memphis, Tennessee, accused of second-degree murder in the death of <strong>Tyre Nichols</strong> pled not guilty. They also face charges of aggravated assault and official misconduct, among others, and are out on bail. They stopped Nichols’s car and beat him on January 7th; he <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2023/02/01/why-holding-bad-police-officers-to-account-is-so-difficult">died in hospital</a> three days later, prompting nationwide protests.

<h3>The African Union meets</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When the African Union begins its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/02/12/the-african-union-is-less-effective-at-20-than-it-was-at-two">annual summit</a> in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital, on Saturday two items will top the agenda. The first is security. Although Africa is not the war-torn hellscape imagined by some Western commentators, there are many parts where conflict is raging, such as the Sahel, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/02/can-kenya-bring-peace-to-eastern-congo">eastern Congo</a>, northern <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/01/mozambiques-resilient-jihadists">Mozambique</a> and parts of Somalia. The West is becoming increasingly reluctant to send its own soldiers to enforce peace, so the continent’s leaders will discuss how they can raise more money to put African boots on the ground. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The second topic is a lack of food, especially in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, where <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/25/somalia-is-on-the-brink-of-starvation">Somalia is at risk of famine</a>. Drought and the war in Ukraine, which has driven up global food prices, have made things worse, but political dysfunction and poverty are largely to blame. African politicians have historically been unable to rise to the continent’s myriad challenges. The least they can do is take steps to prevent them from getting worse. </p>
<h3>Carnival returns to Brazil</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Brazil’s first post-pandemic <em>carnaval</em> officially starts on Saturday. Most of the 26 state capitals will host parades of <em>escolas de samba</em>, the associations of dancers and revellers that compete every year for the title of best performance. More than 450 street parties, or <em>blocos de rua</em>, are scheduled in Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">It is also the first carnival since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/26/as-lula-takes-over-brazils-economic-prospects-are-looking-up">took office for a third term in January</a>. He is popular among artists. His right-wing predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, dissolved the ministry of culture and defunded artistic organisations. Lula, by contrast, has allocated a record 10bn reais ($1.9bn) to the reconstituted ministry. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2019 carnival revellers wore orange, the word for which—<em>laranja</em>—also refers to someone who facilitates fraud. It was a jibe at Mr Bolsonaro, whose son, also a politician, was embroiled in financial scandals. This year, at a pre-carnival <em>bloco </em>in São Paulo, partygoers chanted Lula’s name and wore red, the colour of his Workers’ Party. The party’s past scandals have, for now, been forgotten.</p>
<h3>Bangalore gets a new museum</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Indian government treats its museums <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/special-report/2018/08/14/feeding-the-culture-vultures">quite shabbily</a>. Money and resources are in short supply and leadership, in some cases, is non-existent. The new Museum of Art and Photography (MAP), which opens in Bangalore on Saturday, promises to show up the authorities. Founded by Abhishek Poddar, an industrialist, with a gift of $7m—as well as 7,000 artworks—MAP will bring together paintings, textiles, sculpture, tribal art, Bollywood memorabilia and an extraordinary collection of photography that dates back to the mid-19th century.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Appropriately for a museum in India’s techiest city, MAP’s reach will extend far beyond its state-of-the-art building and bright exhibition spaces. Virtual visitors can expect digital tours, podcasts of artists’ talks and a multimedia gallery where the whole collection can be viewed even when it is not on display. MAP is a museum not just of and for India but for the world.</p>
<h3>A step towards a contraceptive pill for men?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Women may pick from a range of contraceptive options. Men, by contrast, have thus far had just two choices: condoms and vasectomy. For decades none of the injections, gels and hormonal pills developed for men has so far advanced beyond clinical trials.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In a new paper researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine, a medical school in New York, put forward a new candidate: a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/15/a-step-towards-a-contraceptive-pill-for-men">fast-acting pill</a>. In mice it works within half an hour, making the animals temporarily infertile by stopping their sperm from swimming. It has no perceptible effects on their behaviour or sexual performance. Within a day their fertility returns. More animal tests will be needed before trials on people can go ahead. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Generally men have less control over family planning than women do, and sometimes feel little responsibility for it. The breakthrough, said one of the authors, “gives men the ability to be a partner”. Who knows? Some of them might even give it a try. </p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Peter Obi, the man shaking up Nigeria’s presidential race</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“What do I offer you: coffee, tea, water?” asks Peter Obi, the minor-party candidate leading the polls to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/14/can-a-political-underdog-save-nigeria">become Nigeria’s president</a>. Such hospitality is de rigueur among African politicians. But usually the Big Man barks out an order; a flunky proffers the drinks. With Mr Obi, things are different. He fetches tea for your correspondent himself and asks, “Do you need honey?”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In the egotistical world of Nigerian politics, Mr Obi’s humility is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2023/02/12/on-the-trail-with-the-surprise-front-runner-in-nigerias-presidential-race">refreshing</a>. The army of young supporters hoping to see him <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/09/after-eight-dismal-years-nigeria-prepares-to-replace-president-buhari">elected on February 25th</a>, dubbed “Obidients”, delight in the fact that he often flies economy class, carries his own suitcases and claims to own just two pairs of shoes. They view Mr Obi, aged 61, as a sprightly outsider <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/13/peter-obi-a-man-who-carries-his-own-suitcases-could-be-nigerias-next-president" data-tegid="78486thsc95efl0gsshmaprvs8lknlnb">shaking up Nigeria’s venal, sclerotic political class</a>. By contrast, the two big parties’ candidates—Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar—are in their 70s. America’s government has accused both of corruption (and both deny wrongdoing).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In fact, Mr Obi is no political neophyte, having served two terms as governor of his home state, Anambra, in the south-east. He then stood as Mr Abubakar’s vice-presidential candidate in 2019. Before entering politics he worked as a trader and banker, becoming wealthy—unlike lots of Nigerian politicians—before holding office. But he, too, has faced questions about his finances. He appeared in the Pandora Papers, a leak of the records of financial companies, for owning an undeclared offshore company. He insists there was no deliberate wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The pragmatic Mr Obi seems above all to be selling <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2023/02/15/peter-obi-on-why-he-is-running-to-be-nigerias-president">competence</a>. In conversation he refers to the Human Development Index and the money supply. As governor he left a fiscal surplus to his successor—a rarity. His economic instincts appear to be liberal. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Rival campaigns scoff that Obidients are a paper army that is only influential on Twitter. Many pundits concur. At the previous presidential election the candidate from his Labour Party won just 5,074 votes out of nearly 29m cast. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Still, Mr Obi has energised young, urban voters across Nigeria’s main divisions of geography, ethnicity and religion. (The country is divided between a largely Christian south and Muslim north; Mr Obi is Christian.) By making this election about competence, character and perhaps even ideas, he promises to upset the old electoral calculus based on horse-trading. When asked what distinguishes him most from the other two major candidates Mr Obi replies: “Who can people trust?”</p>
