<p class="customisedFont"><strong>OPEC </strong>and its allies decided not to change their production targets as the cartel of oil-producing states waits to ascertain the impact of a new Western <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/30/the-wests-proposed-price-cap-on-russian-oil-is-no-magic-weapon">price cap</a> on Russian crude. On Friday diplomats from the EU, the G7 and Australia agreed to cap Russian oil at $60 per barrel in an attempt to squeeze Russia’s revenues. <strong>Russia</strong> said it “will not accept” the cap<strong>, </strong>though admitted it had prepared for it. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called the policy “weak”, saying it would not cause “serious” damage to Russia.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">There were reports that <strong>Iran</strong> was considering abolishing its morality police. Many observers were sceptical, but if true it would be a sign that the government may be bowing to ongoing protests. The unrest started in September after <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/films/2022/11/08/is-iran-on-the-edge-of-a-revolution">Mahsa Amini</a>, a 22-year-old woman, died in custody having been arrested for violating the country’s dress code. On Saturday Iran’s attorney-general, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, said parliament was reviewing a law requiring women to wear a hijab. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, president of the European Commission, said that the EU must “adapt” its state-aid rules in the face of American climate legislation. European leaders fear that America’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/joe-bidens-signature-legislation-passes-the-senate-at-last">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which offers subsidies worth nearly $400bn for green industries, will draw investment away from the EU. During Emmanuel Macron’s visit to America last week, Joe Biden said that “tweaks” could be made to the legislation to allay European concerns. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Demonstrators in <strong>Syria </strong>attacked and set on fire the governor’s office in the southern city of Sweida. Heavy gunfire was reported during the incident. Earlier, hundreds of people had gathered outside the office protesting against spiralling prices, hunger and economic hardship, demanding the resignation of the president, <strong>Bashar al-Assad</strong>. The civil war, in particular, resulted in a severe contraction of the economy.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region in north-west <strong>China</strong>, announced a lifting of <strong>covid restrictions</strong> after <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest">unprecedented protests</a> against the government’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/28/chinas-economy-cannot-bear-much-more-zero-covid">zero-covid</a> policies. The city, where the wave of protests initially began, will reopen malls, restaurants, markets and some other venues from Monday. Other Chinese cities have recently eased restrictions as well in response to the popular unrest.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A <strong>volcano</strong> has erupted on <strong>Indonesia</strong>’s main island, Java, prompting the evacuation of almost 2,000 people as authorities issued a highest-level alert. Injuries have not immediately been reported, but residents were warned to keep 8km from Mount Semeru as it blasted clouds of ash and poured streams of lava. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/11/14/indonesia-is-poised-for-a-boom-politics-permitting">Indonesia</a> experiences frequent <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2017/12/02/fiery-mount-agung-is-just-one-of-127-active-volcanoes-in-indonesia">volcanic activity</a>; Semeru last erupted one year ago, killing 51 people.</p>

<h3>War lessons from Ukraine</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Open source intelligence, like YouTube footage of drone strikes and tank battles, has given the public unprecedented insight into war. But it can also mislead. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/11/30/what-is-the-war-in-ukraine-teaching-western-armies">new report</a> by the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London, draws on Ukrainian military data to bust some myths. What made the difference in the first weeks of the conflict, for instance, was not Western anti-tank missiles and Turkish drones, feted on social media, but huge volumes of artillery to stop the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/why-a-huge-russian-convoy-remains-stalled-north-of-kyiv">Russians north of Kyiv.</a></p>
<p class="customisedFont">That is a sobering thought for European armies, all of which have less artillery than Ukraine did in February. Drones were important, but 90% of all those that Ukraine deployed between February and July were destroyed. Deception played a vital role. On one occasion Ukraine photographed a destroyed airfield and printed the images onto a large tarpaulin to trick Russian satellites. “This led…amusingly,” the report notes, “to the Russians debating whether Ukrainian fighter aircraft were operating from subterranean shelters.”</p>
<h3>Democrats’ last weeks of power in the House</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Nothing clarifies priorities like a tight deadline, and America’s Democrats are staring down two. The first is December 16th, when annual federal funding expires; Congress needs to pass a spending bill or extend the deadline to avoid a government shutdown. The second is January 3rd, when control of the House of Representatives will <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/11/17/in-a-republican-house-investigations-and-fiscal-clashes-loom">flip to Republicans</a>. Democrats have tried to use their waning days of unified control of Congress to push through some final bills.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">They are set to cross one off their list, a law enshrining the protection of same-sex and interracial marriages. Less realistically, they want to ban assault rifles and protect the residency rights of undocumented <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/11/24/congress-should-act-now-to-protect-dreamers">immigrants who were brought to America as children</a>. Neither is likely to get the necessary 60 votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. On Tuesday a run-off election in Georgia may see Democrats add to their slim majority in the upper chamber next year. But with Republicans set to control the House, expect legislative gridlock come January.</p>
<h3>England’s cricket tour of Pakistan</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In March 2009 Islamist militants <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2009/03/03/game-over">attacked</a> a bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team to play a match in the Pakistani city of Lahore. Eight people were killed. The assault also pushed Pakistani cricket into exile. For the next decade, no international team would visit the country and home matches were shifted to the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet cricket in Pakistan has stayed on its feet. The team won two international trophies and a successful Twenty20 franchise league was introduced. And now it is hosting international cricket again. Since Sri Lanka returned in 2019, Australia, Bangladesh, and South Africa have visited. This month England is touring. For cricket-mad Pakistanis living through economic and political turmoil, the three Test matches will be a welcome distraction. They have already been entertained—albeit at their team’s expense. England kicked things off on Thursday by smashing 506 runs, a record for the first day of a Test.</p>
<h3>The Beach Boys: more than just “Good Vibrations”</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For most listeners, the Beach Boys’ catalogue both peaks and ends with the album “Pet Sounds” and the single “Good Vibrations”, both masterpieces from 1966. Yet over the following seven years the band would release eight more albums which, although they sold poorly, would form an influential body of work.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A new reissue, “Sail On Sailor: 1972”, collects the final LPs of this sequence, “Carl and the Passions—So Tough” and “Holland”. These records were made in the near-absence of the band’s guiding genius, Brian Wilson, but the rest of the band stepped up in his place. “Holland” in particular is an undervalued marvel. Mr Wilson’s late brothers Dennis and Carl shine creatively, and new members Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar come to the fore on the eponymous “Sail On Sailor”, a classic rock number. The Beach Boys retained their fascination long after their commercial pomp.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Alexie, a protester in Shanghai</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Alexie has joined two protests in her life. Both times, the Shanghai coffee-shop owner (whose name we have changed) chanted slogans against China’s government—a good way to risk a jail sentence. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2019, to express her own discontent with China’s growing authoritarianism, she travelled to Hong Kong, where she marched with millions of others calling for democratic rule in the territory. She was unable to tell anyone who she was and what she was doing there. “I felt alone, but paradoxically, I had never felt so close to the people around me,” she says.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In the three years since, Chinese officials have only tightened their grip on Hong Kong. Many there have lost hope. Alexie has, too. She considered leaving China on several occasions but ultimately decided against it: not because she didn’t have the means, but because of her “unspeakably deep connections” with her homeland. Alexie is a globetrotter—having lived in Argentina and travelled to nearly all continents, she came back to China four years ago, hoping to establish a stable life, even though it soon started to become “unbearable”, not least because of the prolonged covid-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Last Saturday night, she found some solace. She learned from friends that<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest"> protesters were gathering</a> on Wulumuqi Road, just three kilometres from her apartment. Taking a bouquet of flowers and sheets of white paper, the symbolic weapons of these protests, she joined them. She laid flowers in tribute to the families who had died two days before in a fire in an apartment building in Xinjiang, in far-west China. The building’s exits had reportedly been sealed, to comply with<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows"> China’s zero-covid policy</a>. The blank paper is more explicitly political, a challenge to China’s strict controls on free expression. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">She could hear the chanting from a few blocks away. “No to PCR testing, yes to freedom.” When one person shouted, “Communist Party!”, a handful of people responded tentatively, “Step down!”. Again, the man shouted “Communist Party!”. This time the response was stronger and more joined in, including Alexie: “Step down!”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The next day, clips of the protest she attended flooded Twitter, which is blocked in China but accessed by people with virtual private networks. With dread she stopped the videos on each frame to check if her face was visible (it wasn’t). “I was afraid, and still am, but I just had to go,” she says.</p>
