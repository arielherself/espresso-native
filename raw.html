<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elon Musk</strong> completed his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/11/will-elon-musk-owned-twitter-end-up-as-a-deal-from-hell">on-off-on takeover</a> of <strong>Twitter</strong>, closing the deal at $44bn. The world’s richest man swiftly sacked the social-media platform’s CEO, Parag Agrawal, and several other top executives. It was reported that Mr Musk is to play the role of CEO himself, as he does already at Tesla and SpaceX—and to lift “lifetime” bans for some users. Despite promising to limit censorship on the site, Mr Musk must also convince <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up">advertisers</a> that Twitter will not descend into a free-for-all. Ads constituted nearly nine-tenths of Twitter’s revenues last year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Germany’s</strong> economy unexpectedly grew by 0.3% in the third quarter of the year, as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/11/germany-faces-a-looming-threat-of-deindustrialisation">high energy prices</a> and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/10/28/frances-finance-minister-on-how-to-fight-inflation-and-preserve-stability">rising interest rates</a> dampened growth across Europe. <strong>France</strong> and <strong>Spain</strong> slowed to 0.2% growth in the same period. Earlier <strong>America’s</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/27/strong-gdp-figures-will-not-help-the-democrats-in-the-midterms">economy expanded </a>by 2.6% in the third quarter, its strongest annualised <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/02/americas-economy-is-too-strong-for-its-own-good">growth rate</a> since last year, largely due to a drop in imports and a surge in exports.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, said that Russia has launched more than 30 <strong>drone strikes</strong> in the past two days. Western officials believe that the deployed <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/19/will-russias-drone-attacks-change-the-war-in-ukraine">“kamikaze” drones</a> are being supplied by Iran, although the country denies it. Mr Zelensky said that Ukraine has endured 4,500 missile strikes and more than 8,000 air raids, but pledged to “clip the wings” of the Kremlin’s air forces.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Japan’s </strong>prime minister, Kishida Fumio, announced an extra budget to expand by 68% the size of a <strong>stimulus package </strong>now worth a total of ¥71.6trn ($490bn). The spending is supposed to ease the burdens imposed by inflation (and to defend the government’s meagre popularity). The Bank of Japan meanwhile left <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/29/japans-monetary-policymakers-are-sticking-to-their-guns">its benchmark</a> rate steady, in ultra-low territory, the day after the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/films/2022/06/09/why-do-central-banks-raise-interest-rates">European Central Bank</a> doubled its own.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Amazon’s</strong> share price plummeted by about 15% in post-session trading. The e-retailer’s quarterly revenues grew by 15% year on year, to $127.1bn, but fell short of forecasts. Net income declined by 9%, to $2.9bn. <strong>Apple</strong>, meanwhile, beat analysts’ expectations and reported record results for the July-to-September quarter. Revenues for the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/07/31/apple-already-sold-everyone-an-iphone-now-what">iPhone-maker</a> rose by 8% year on year, to $90.1bn; net income was $20.7bn.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Intel</strong> said it would look to hack as much as $10bn by 2025 from its annual costs, following a worse-than-expected earnings release. The American <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/17/the-american-chip-industrys-15trn-meltdown">chipmaker</a> reported third-quarter revenue of $15.3bn, down 20% year on year. Much of the saving is expected to come from job cuts. The firm blamed weak demand for the PCs that carry its chips.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The IMF cut its forecast for <strong>economic growth </strong>in <strong>Asia </strong>this year, from 4.3% to 4%. The fund said that a myriad of factors were weighing on the region, including rising <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/23/even-super-tight-policy-is-not-bringing-down-inflation">interest rates and inflation</a>, an unrelated <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/20/chinas-rulers-seem-resigned-to-a-slowing-economy">slowdown in China</a> and the war in Ukraine. The region grew by 6.5% in 2021.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Fact of the day: </strong>61%, the share of countries where adherence to the rule of law fell in the past year, according to the World Justice Project. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/26/the-eu-is-strengthening-democracy-in-eastern-europe">Read the full article</a>.</p>

<h3>Meta’s unhappy anniversary</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">One year ago on Friday Mark Zuckerberg changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta. Under that new banner just about <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/10/16/how-much-trouble-is-mark-zuckerberg-in">everything has gone wrong</a>. Earlier this year the company reported its first year-on-year drop in quarterly revenue and the first decline in users of Facebook, its social network. Investors hoped it was a blip. But on Wednesday Meta said quarterly revenue had fallen again, by 4%, and predicted it would drop in the next quarter too. In response the company’s share price plunged by nearly a quarter.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But these are mere Earthly problems. Mr Zuckerberg believes his company’s future lies in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/11/what-is-the-metaverse">metaverse</a>, an online space to work, play and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/18/the-300bn-google-meta-advertising-duopoly-is-under-attack">watch ads</a>. Meta has spent tens of billions of dollars building it. But fewer than 200,000 people reportedly use Meta’s flagship metaverse app. One day the metaverse may take off. The question is whether Meta, which has lost more than 70% of its market value this year, will still be around then.</p>
<h3>The beat of a different drum in Pakistan</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday Imran Khan begins a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2022/08/25/on-the-comeback-trail-with-imran-khan">protest march</a> of about 380km from the eastern city of Lahore to Islamabad, the capital. Pakistan’s former prime minister demands that elections, scheduled for late next year, are brought forward. Mr Khan was ousted earlier this year by a vote of no confidence. He is hoping that a show of street power will pile pressure on the government to dissolve parliament. The former cricketer-turned-politician has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/10/20/imran-khan-appears-to-be-more-popular-than-ever">gathered support</a> by spinning a fantastical tale of an American plot to oust him from office. He recently presented himself as a headline candidate in a clutch of by-elections; he won six of seven seats.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Khan’s march adds to Pakistan’s other political and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/06/02/imran-khan-is-jeopardising-pakistans-attempts-to-fix-its-economy">economic woes</a>. Massive flooding this monsoon season caused an estimated $40bn in damages. The country is battling high inflation and energy shortages, as well as seeking $27bn in debt rescheduling, much of it from China. If the government cracks down on Mr Khan’s march, more political turmoil will follow.</p>
<h3>More gushing profits for Exxon</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">ExxonMobil played down its quarterly earnings ahead of their release. But on Friday America’s largest oil firm logged $20bn in profits, nearly triple last year’s result, despite <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets">oil prices</a> falling from the dizzying heights seen after Russia invaded Ukraine. Margins were boosted by sales of pricey natural gas, especially to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/11/the-countries-most-at-risk-from-europes-energy-crunch">energy-starved Europe</a>. Now gas prices have receded but oil prices are rising again, boosted by a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut">big cut</a> to the monthly output target of OPEC+, a cartel of producers.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Exxon still has worries. Earlier in October the company left Russia empty-handed after President Vladimir Putin expropriated some of its Russian assets. And its shiny profits will set the stage for more clashes with the Biden administration over caps on fuel exports, as politicians blame the supermajors for soaring energy prices. But for the foreseeable future, energy scarcity will keep pumping the company’s coffers.</p>
<h3>Northern Ireland heads to elections, again</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Northern Ireland has had no regional government since February. Each of its two biggest parties can block the other from governing. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215">Sinn Féin</a>, which won its first election in May, wants a united Ireland. The runner-up Democratic Unionist Party wants to keep Northern Ireland British. At midnight on Friday, six months since the last election, their time to re-establish a power-sharing government ran out, triggering a fresh election. It will probably be held on December 15th. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Both parties are expected to consolidate their positions with voters. Whichever wins, their main contention—on the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/06/16/the-northern-ireland-protocol-enrages-some-businesses-pleases-others">Northern Ireland protocol</a> that created a new Irish Sea border with Britain after Brexit—will remain unresolved. To prevent the region from stagnating in the meantime, Westminster may give more power to civil servants, who effectively ran the country the last time the government collapsed in 2017. Then, it took three years to replace them with politicians. The lengthy backlog of untaken government decisions looks set to grow.</p>
<h3>When Harry Met Harry</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday “Bros”, one of Hollywood’s first gay romantic comedies, is released in Britain. Co-written by its star, Billy Eichner (“Parks and Recreation”), and by its director, Nicholas Stoller (“Forgetting Sarah Marshall”), the film is a sweetly old-fashioned New York rom-com in many respects. Mr Eichner plays a celebrity podcaster who doesn’t want a long-term relationship but might be persuaded by a hunky lawyer (Luke Macfarlane) he meets at a party.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The film is anxious to mark itself apart from heterosexual smash hits, making copious references to Grindr, poppers, threesomes and foursomes. It also takes some satirical swipes at “Brokeback Mountain” and other gay-themed dramas with straight casts: the numerous <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/prospero/2017/03/21/disney-has-drawn-an-outline-for-gay-characters">LGBT characters</a> in “Bros” are all played by LGBT actors. American box-office sales have so far disappointed. Mr Eichner partly blamed homophobia. But the fact is that grown-up, sincere romantic comedies are out of fashion, whatever the sexuality of their leads.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 BST on <strong>Friday</strong> to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@economist.com"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8cddf9e5f6c9fffcfee9ffffe3cce9efe3e2e3e1e5fff8a2efe3e1">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown one winner per continent on Saturday.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Friday: </strong>Which singer-songwriter gave a rapid tour of modern history in his song “We Didn’t Start the Fire”?</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Thursday: </strong>Which American swimmer was the star of a series of “aquamusicals” in the late 1940s and early ’50s?</p>
