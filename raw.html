The former foreign secretary was officially invited to form a government by Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, a day after she was elected Conservative party leader. Ms Truss will swiftly turn to a plan to freeze <strong>energy prices</strong> for British households, which are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/08/26/energy-bills-in-britain-are-soaring">expected to rise</a> by 80% in October.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>European Commission </strong>inched closer to fixing prices in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/01/europe-scrambles-to-protect-consumers-against-dizzying-energy-prices">natural-gas markets</a>. <strong>Gas prices</strong> rose dramatically on Monday morning as markets reacted to <strong>Russia’s </strong>indefinite suspension of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The <em>Financial Times </em>reported that the EC would recommend options for an “emergency wholesale price cap”, to be observed by all member-states, along with ways to reduce demand. Meanwhile <strong>OPEC</strong> and its allies, including Russia, agreed to cut <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/three-big-uncertainties-cloud-the-oil-market/21808307">oil production</a> in an effort to boost sagging prices. The reduction of output by 100,000 barrels per day corresponds to just 0.1% of global demand.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Volkswagen</strong>, a German car giant, announced that it would list <strong>Porsche</strong>, its sports-car marque, in what could be one of the largest IPOs in years.

VW has owned the brand since 2012, but rumours about a decoupling have been <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/02/26/porsche-and-volkswagen-are-set-to-uncouple-at-last">circulating for months</a>.

China’s currency has suddenly weakened this year after lockdowns hampered exports. The central bank also reduced the amount of foreign currency that Chinese banks need to hold, another sign of its desire to prop up the sliding yuan.</p>

<h3>Challenges for Britain’s new prime minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/05/what-kind-of-prime-minister-will-liz-truss-be">Liz Truss</a> flew to Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where Queen Elizabeth II invited her to form a new British government. The meeting was secured by the 57.4% of Conservative Party members who picked the current foreign secretary as party leader over her rival, Rishi Sunak.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">That was enough to give Ms Truss the job she craved. But her majority was not as impressive as polling had suggested. She also did worse than her immediate predecessors. Boris Johnson secured 66% of members’ votes in 2019. In 2005 David Cameron scooped 68%.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In an earlier round Ms Truss was backed by just 32% of Tory MPs. Behind Mr Sunak, hers was the lowest share of support of any candidate who has gone on to win since the current rules were introduced in 1998. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/11/who-will-replace-boris-johnson">weak internal mandate</a> is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/07/06/a-monstrous-in-tray-awaits-boris-johnsons-eventual-successor">ominous</a>. Ms Truss will need to lead her increasingly rebellious party through an <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/01/how-to-prevent-europes-energy-crunch-spiralling-into-an-economic-crisis">energy crisis</a> afflicting all of Europe. Recent Tory leaders have had short tenures. Ms Truss will have to work hard to secure her standing among her colleagues.</p>
<h3>Painful reminders for Germany and Israel</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, addressed the German Bundestag on Tuesday. His speech marked the climax of a visit to mark the 50th anniversary of the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches by Palestinian terrorists at the Munich Olympics in 1972.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The run-up to the anniversary was tense. In July victims’ families rejected a German compensation offer and said they would not attend a commemoration ceremony on Monday. After a last-minute deal, including an official apology for security lapses and payments to families, that decision was reversed. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s president, called it “shameful” that it had taken 50 years to reach a settlement.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Later Mr Herzog will travel to the site of the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp. As a soldier in the British army his father, Chaim Herzog, helped to liberate the camp in 1945. The elder Herzog later became the sixth president of Israel. The symbolism of the 11th president’s trip, both personal and political, is clear.</p>
<h3>Rainbow stagnation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">South Africa ought to be the industrial engine of its continent. Yet its economic performance has been disappointing for a decade and a half. Though incomes grew for most people after the end of white rule in 1994, over the past ten years only the top 5% have gained in real terms. That has exacerbated already grotesque inequality. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">So when the country gets its latest GDP figures on Tuesday, for the second quarter of this year, forgive South Africans for greeting them with a shrug. The data are expected to show a continuing slow rebound from an awful two years of the pandemic. But because firms have been hindered by record <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/29/why-the-lights-are-going-out-again-in-south-africa">blackouts</a>, due to the dysfunctional state power company, there will not be a huge surge in activity. That is what would be required to put a dent in an unemployment rate of 34%, the highest known rate in the world.</p>
<h3>The end of Australia’s housing boom</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/01/the-global-housing-boom-is-running-out-of-steam">Housing booms</a> in many overheated markets are ending as policymakers raise interest rates to curb inflation. Australia’s market, one of the frothiest, is weathering its sharpest downturn in almost 40 years. Prices nationally have fallen by 3.4% since the central bank started tightening monetary policy in May, according to CoreLogic, a property-data firm. In Sydney house prices are shedding almost A$1,000 ($680) a day.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">That may be only the start. Annual consumer-price inflation is at 6.1%. On Tuesday the Reserve Bank increased interest rates for the fifth consecutive month, by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.35%. Economists reckon that house prices could slump by up to 20% from their peaks. Since some Australian households are among the world’s most indebted, that will hurt. Yet a recession is not yet looming. And even if house prices fell by a fifth, they would still be higher than they were before the pandemic.</p>
<h3>The story of Stewart Brand</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em>, first published in 1968, was an eclectic compendium of tools to help its readers live more sustainable lives. A documentary, released on streaming platforms on Tuesday, about its editor, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/04/06/stewart-brands-belief-in-technology-helped-shape-silicon-valley">Stewart Brand</a>, takes its name from the opening sentence of the <em>Catalog</em>: “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Environmentalists loved the <em>Catalog</em>. But its most enduring impact was in Silicon Valley, where its techno-utopian philosophy took hold. Mr Brand mingled with early computer pioneers, and helped develop the open-source philosophy critical to modern software. Steve Jobs, the late boss of Apple, referred to the periodical as “one of the bibles of my generation.” </p>
<p class="customisedFont">“We Are As Gods” chronicles one of Mr Brand’s more recent projects: using genetic engineering to bring back the woolly mammoth from extinction. To his critics this is hubristic meddling. But with his deep faith in technology, to Mr Brand it is just a new form of conservation.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
