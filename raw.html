<p class="customisedFont">Diplomats from the <strong>EU</strong> agreed on a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/30/the-wests-proposed-price-cap-on-russian-oil-is-no-magic-weapon">price cap</a> for <strong>Russian oil</strong> of $60 per barrel. The policy aims to squeeze Russia’s revenue by prohibiting Western firms from insuring, shipping or trading Russian crude anywhere in the world unless it is sold below the cap. The G7 and Australia also endorsed the plan, saying it would take effect on December 5th or soon after.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia</strong> is seeking to encircle the town of <strong>Bakhmut</strong> in eastern Ukraine, Britain’s defence ministry said. The town carries little strategic value but has gained “symbolic” significance for the Kremlin, the ministry added. An adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, suggested that Russia was waiting until temperatures dropped to around minus 10°C to launch a new wave of strikes.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Employers in <strong>America</strong> added more jobs than expected—263,000—to <strong>non-farm payrolls</strong> in November. A separate household survey showed that 186,000 people left the labour force, putting <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/why-american-unemployment-needs-to-rise">pressure on wages</a>, which rose by 0.6% in November from the previous month. Strong hiring and pay growth are unlikely to deter the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> from its highly telegraphed plan to ease interest-rate increases in December.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>World Health Organisation</strong> said that 90% of the world now have some resistance to <strong>covid-19</strong>, but warned that a new variant causing “significant mortality” could still emerge. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said “gaps in surveillance, testing, sequencing and vaccination” persist around the world. Meanwhile <strong>China</strong> began easing restrictions in major cities in what the country’s covid tsar, Sun Chunlan, called a “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/12/01/xi-jinpings-zero-covid-policy-has-turned-a-health-crisis-into-a-political-one">new stage</a>” in the fight against the virus.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Twitter</strong> is relying more on automation to moderate content, according to the company’s new head of trust and safety. Researchers have reported a surge in hate speech on the social-media platform since it was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/12/01/elon-musk-is-showing-what-a-waste-of-time-twitter-can-be">acquired by Elon Musk</a> in October. Meanwhile Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, held a “clear and honest discussion” with Mr Musk. Afterwards, he said Twitter’s content-moderation policies must comply with European regulations.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s <strong>Democratic Party </strong>moved a step closer to unseating Iowa from its traditional role as the first state to hold <strong>presidential primaries</strong>. Under a plan pushed by President Joe Biden, the party&#x27;s first primary in 2024 would take place in South Carolina, a more diverse state. Members of an important party committee backed the proposal, but a final decision will not be made until February.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Football World Cup:</strong> The<strong> knockout round</strong> of the tournament begins after a group stage punctuated by a series of extraordinary <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even">upsets</a>. Germany, four-time champions, and Belgium, semi-finalists in 2018, failed to make the cut. Representatives from six continents will play out the round of 16 in the coming days. On Saturday America and the Netherlands will open proceedings.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>fumuguan,</em> a Chinese word meaning “father-mother official” and often used to describe local magistrates in imperial times. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest">Read for the full story</a>.</p>

<h3>Migration in the Med</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, is due to address an annual conference about security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region—a touchy subject for her government. In October Italy <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/11/17/a-new-migration-crisis-is-brewing-in-europe">refused to accept</a> a ship carrying 234 migrants who had been rescued off the coast of Libya. France ultimately allowed it to dock after a bitter tussle with Ms Meloni. Calling her government’s stance “incomprehensible and unacceptable”, the French suspended an agreement to settle 3,500 asylum-seekers currently in Italy. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">That deal, struck in June by 18 EU members, was already falling short. Under the pact northern European countries agreed to accept 8,000 asylum-seekers from their southern neighbours within a year. But by mid-November only 117 had been relocated. Expect Ms Meloni to voice the complaint of many Italians—that Italy is being left to deal with Mediterranean migration by itself.</p>
<h3>Native Americans fight for sacred land</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Saturday is America’s first Tribal Museums Day. But the celebration takes place amid tension over sacred land in Arizona. Chi’chil Bildagoteel, which measures 6.7 square miles (17.4 sq km), is owned by the federal government. It is also an important religious site for members of the Apache tribe. The Trump administration arranged to transfer it to Rio Tinto and BHP, two multinational mining firms, in a land swap; the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/the-energy-transition-is-sparking-americas-next-mining-boom/21807704">copper mine</a> planned for the site could become America’s largest.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Tribal leaders, who gathered this week in Arizona for the Sacred Sites Summit, say that protecting particular sites is a “holy war”. Last year Apache representatives sued the federal government, claiming that losing Chi’chil Bildagoteel would curtail their religious freedom. An appeals court upheld a district-court ruling against them, but in November it agreed to rehear the case. A win for the Apache could help protect other sacred lands—and ensure that they remain part of a living culture, not one relegated to museums alone.</p>
<h3>Next up at the World Cup</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It has taken 48 matches to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even">trim the 32 teams</a> at the football World Cup to 16. Now as the tournament enters the knockout stages on Saturday, it will take just 15 games to reveal a champion. Several fancied teams have made strong starts and look like contenders. The holders, France, should ease past Poland. Likewise, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/11/17/lionel-messi-and-cristiano-ronaldo-have-forged-modern-football">Lionel Messi’s</a> Argentina against Australia. England, too, should have enough attacking prowess to beat Senegal. And Brazil remain favourites to end their 20-year trophy drought. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But there is also plenty of scope for upsets. America will be energetic opponents for the Netherlands, who were not properly tested in a weak group. Morocco, playing in their first knockout match since 1986 and unbeaten so far, will relish the chance to take on Spain. And Japan, fresh from shocking Germany and Spain, will be looking for another European scalp in Croatia, the beaten finalists in 2018.</p>
<h3>The Sydney Modern opens</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Its opening is being called Sydney’s biggest cultural development since the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/prospero/2018/10/19/the-sydney-opera-house-then-and-now">Opera House</a> was completed nearly 50 years ago. But unlike that landmark, the Sydney Modern, a gallery which opens on Saturday, does not disrupt the skyline: it hunkers into the harbourside, all glass walls and grass-covered roof. The project, costing A$344m ($234m), aims instead to make a mark with its exhibitions. It nearly doubles the floor space of the adjacent Art Gallery of New South Wales and features work by more than 900 artists, including indigenous Australians. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Sydneysiders blush at how their city gets outshone culturally by Melbourne, known for its thriving arts scene. The new gallery aspires to compete with London’s Tate Modern or New York’s Guggenheim, said Ben Franklin, a minister for arts and tourism. Thousands of Sydneysiders have registered to visit. The gallery’s creators will hope for global attention too.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Alexie, a protester in Shanghai</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Alexie has joined two protests in her life. Both times, the Shanghai coffee-shop owner (whose name we have changed) chanted slogans against China’s government—a good way to risk a jail sentence. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2019, to express her own discontent with China’s growing authoritarianism, she travelled to Hong Kong, where she marched with millions of others calling for democratic rule in the territory. She was unable to tell anyone who she was and what she was doing there. “I felt alone, but paradoxically, I had never felt so close to the people around me,” she says.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In the three years since, Chinese officials have only tightened their grip on Hong Kong. Many there have lost hope. Alexie has, too. She considered leaving China on several occasions but ultimately decided against it: not because she didn’t have the means, but because of her “unspeakably deep connections” with her homeland. Alexie is a globetrotter—having lived in Argentina and travelled to nearly all continents, she came back to China four years ago, hoping to establish a stable life, even though it soon started to become “unbearable”, not least because of the prolonged covid-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Last Saturday night, she found some solace. She learned from friends that<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest"> protesters were gathering</a> on Wulumuqi Road, just three kilometres from her apartment. Taking a bouquet of flowers and sheets of white paper, the symbolic weapons of these protests, she joined them. She laid flowers in tribute to the families who had died two days before in a fire in an apartment building in Xinjiang, in far-west China. The building’s exits had reportedly been sealed, to comply with<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows"> China’s zero-covid policy</a>. The blank paper is more explicitly political, a challenge to China’s strict controls on free expression. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">She could hear the chanting from a few blocks away. “No to PCR testing, yes to freedom.” When one person shouted, “Communist Party!”, a handful of people responded tentatively, “Step down!”. Again, the man shouted “Communist Party!”. This time the response was stronger and more joined in, including Alexie: “Step down!”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The next day, clips of the protest she attended flooded Twitter, which is blocked in China but accessed by people with virtual private networks. With dread she stopped the videos on each frame to check if her face was visible (it wasn’t). “I was afraid, and still am, but I just had to go,” she says.</p>
