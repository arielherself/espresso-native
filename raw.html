<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine’s</strong> national atomic-energy company said that Russian shelling had damaged the “infrastructure” of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant"><strong>Zaporizhia nuclear power station</strong></a> in the south-east of the country, risking a leak of radioactive substances. Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling the Russian-occupied plant. Russia refused to approve a revision to the UN’s Non-Proliferation Treaty because it would commit signatories to expressing “grave concern” about Zaporizhia.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s S&amp;P 500 <strong>stockmarket</strong> index fell by 3.4% on Friday after hawkish remarks by Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, at an annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Tackling inflation, Mr Powell said, was “likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth” but the Fed “must keep at it until the job is done”. In July <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/27/the-fed-is-no-longer-taking-baby-steps-to-rein-in-inflation">the Fed</a> announced its second consecutive 0.75-percentage-point rate rise.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Gita Gopinath, the deputy head of the <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong>, warned that a consequence of the Fed’s tighter monetary policy—the strong dollar—will make it harder for poor countries to repay their debts. In an interview with Bloomberg TV she suggested that rich countries ought to improve programmes to help them, saying “a lot more speedy action is needed”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The UN called for a ceasefire after clashes between the <strong>Libyan</strong> government and a rebel militia on Saturday. According to the health ministry 23 people were killed. A UN-brokered peace deal in 2020 ended the political violence that consumed the country for nearly a decade after the fall of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, but Saturday’s fighting suggests that sectarian conflict may be returning</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Officials in <strong>Pakistan</strong> said that the death toll from <strong>floods</strong> after heavy monsoon rains that have afflicted the country since mid-June had risen to nearly 1,000. In appealing for international help on Friday, the prime minister, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/08/13/pakistans-prime-minister-on-his-drive-to-modernise-the-country">Shehbaz Sharif</a>, said that 33m of Pakistan’s 230m people had been affected by the floods.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> and <strong>China</strong> reached an agreement that could avert the delisting of hundreds of Chinese companies from American <strong>stock exchanges</strong>. The deal will enable American regulators to examine audit documents, which Chinese authorities have resisted. Companies face delisting if they fail to show regulators their books for three years. In August five Chinese state-owned companies said they would delist.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s Department of Justice unsealed the <strong>affidavit </strong>that authorised the search of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month. The heavily redacted version, written by an FBI special agent, claimed there was “probable cause” to believe that the former president had not returned <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations" data-tegid="7t2dp12tjq1sal4th9ui10rol5v7mmm7">additional classified documents</a>, and that “evidence of obstruction” would be found at his home.</p>

<h3>Heat and drought in China</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The end of summer cannot come soon enough for tens of millions of residents in the megacities of Chengdu and Chongqing. For weeks Sichuan province in south-west China has experienced record-breaking heat. Temperatures are supposed to cool at the end of August—but much of the damage is already done.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The energy system has been strained by greater demand and weaker supply. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/08/25/a-drought-in-china-hits-industry">drought reduced</a> hydroelectric output by about 50% year on year in the province. Industry has been hit hard. Provincial officials have been forced to tell thousands of manufacturers to cease production. That includes important multinationals such as Toyota, a Japanese carmaker, and Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics group that supplies Apple. The load-shedding ended on August 25th. But the power crunch, the second in as many years, has raised serious questions about China’s ability to cope with the effects of climate change.</p>
<h3>The Church hands out its red hats</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/26/how-new-cardinals-are-changing-the-roman-catholic-church">cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church</a> gather in the Vatican to welcome 20 new “princes of the church” selected by Pope Francis. As the first pontiff from Latin America, he has tilted the college of cardinals towards parts of the world long marginalised by the church—particularly Asia. Timor-Leste, a country of just 1.3m people which is almost 98% Catholic, will get its first cardinal. So will Mongolia, where there are only around 1,300 faithful. The share of European cardinals has fallen from 52% to 40% on Francis’s watch. But Africa, the engine of Catholicism’s growth, remains badly underrepresented.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Of the new cardinals, 16 are part of the smaller group which will pick Francis’s successor. Now aged 85, he has signalled that he may one day retire. He presides over a church finely balanced between <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/07/14/catholic-reformers-want-big-changes-to-a-church-marred-by-sex-abuse">reformers and conservatives</a>. But he will at least influence who follows him: 83 of the 132 cardinal-electors are his choices.</p>
<h3>Farewell to the Mekong Review</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">At a glance the <em>Mekong Review</em>, an English-language magazine, can be compared to many Western literary journals; its simple white cover might be easily mistaken for the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>. But in its content, including reviews, reportage, poetry and fiction, all concerned with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/07/11/what-to-read-to-understand-singapore">South-East Asia</a>, it is unique. Despite only publishing a few thousand copies of each issue, it has attracted a devoted following. But this week, after seven years, the journal’s editors said they were putting down their pens.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Minh Bui Jones, the Australian founder, has found it increasingly difficult to publish in a region dominated by authoritarian governments. In 2020 authorities in Hong Kong forbade the printing of an issue featuring a profile of Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy activist. The following issue, which covered protests in Thailand, was rejected by printers in Bangkok. Logistical difficulties caused by covid-19 lockdowns only made matters worse. That the <em>Mekong Review </em>survived for as long as it did is a triumph.</p>
<h3>The wonders of Elvis up for auction</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Few musicians left a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/06/24/the-strange-case-of-elvis-presleys-musical-posterity">legacy like Elvis</a>. America’s King of Rock ’n’ Roll sold some 500m records in his lifetime, with fan clubs as far off as South Africa and the Philippines. On Saturday his admirers will get a chance to take part of his legacy home when close to 200 of the King’s jewellery pieces, including cufflinks, rings and chains, will be auctioned off. The collection, given by Elvis to his manager Tom Parker, had been long considered lost. This will be the first chance for Elvis aficionados to see, and bid on, the assembled trinkets.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Decades after his death, Elvis continues to rake in millions. The Presley estate is valued at $1bn; a recent biopic directed by Baz Luhrman brought in over $270m at the box office. A single ring in this collection comes with a minimum bid of $130,000. “Your kiss to me is worth a fortune,” the crooner once sang. For deep-pocketed fans, so is his bling.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Michael Heizer, the artist behind “City”</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Richard Nixon was still America’s president when Michael Heizer, one of the country’s foremost land artists, began his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/08/20/a-vast-sculpture-in-the-nevada-desert-is-finished-at-last">mysterious sculpture project</a> in 1972, in the high Nevada desert north of Las Vegas. Few people were allowed to see the work in progress; many thought it would never get done. As the years passed, it took on a mythical quality in the art world.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Naysayers notwithstanding, half a century on, Mr Heizer’s “City” is complete. On September 2nd, it will open to the public—even if, to maintain its atmosphere of splendid isolation, at first only six people a day will be allowed to visit.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">As an artist, Mr Heizer is almost completely self-taught. Fascinated by drawing from an early age, as a teenager in the late 1950s he helped his father, a famous anthropological archaeologist, who was excavating an ancient Olmec site on the Yucatán peninsula. Then he spent a year in Paris, mostly in its museums. “I saw it all first-hand,” he says. “You can’t go to school and learn about art by looking at a bunch of slides projected on a wall.”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The artist started work on “City”, with a huge piece at one end called “Section One”, a rectangular slope surrounded by concrete struts. “I worked entirely intuitively,” he says, “with no ongoing thought or consecutive way of planning.” The finished work is more than a mile and a half long and half a mile wide (2.4km x 800 metres), making it one of the biggest contemporary sculptures ever made. Walking through it feels as much like being in a garden—albeit one with no flowers—as in a city. There are mounds and walkways, as well as discrete spaces that could be neighbourhoods. It is both intimate and epic, forbidding and yet inviting; a work that is utterly itself. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">At 77, Mr Heizer has made his last visit to the site. He lives far away, at sea level, for the sake of his damaged lungs. But his stubbornness is undimmed; he refuses to explain the significance of the work. “It’s the visitor who does the interpretation,” he says. “I don’t give a damn.”</p>
