<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Liz Truss</strong>, Britain’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/05/what-kind-of-prime-minister-will-liz-truss-be">new prime minister</a>, appointed <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong> as chancellor of the exchequer, or finance minister. The son of Ghanian immigrants, Mr Kwarteng—hitherto the business secretary—supports cutting taxes and business regulations, and has encouraged “fiscal loosening” to help households weather rising energy prices. On Thursday Ms Truss is due to unveil a proposal to freeze average annual <strong>energy bills</strong>, which may otherwise <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/08/26/energy-bills-in-britain-are-soaring">jump</a> by 80% in October, at about £2,500 ($2,880). The subsidies could cost up to £100bn, and are expected to be paid for by borrowing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America said <strong>Russia</strong> was trying to buy millions of rockets and artillery shells from <strong>North Korea</strong> for use in Ukraine. The appeal to North Korea “does demonstrate and is indicative of the situation that Russia finds itself in”, said the Pentagon’s spokesman, referring to the impact of sanctions and export controls. He added that there were no details yet about whether payments or shipments had been made.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Juul Labs</strong> agreed in principle to pay $438.5m to 33 American states and Puerto Rico to settle allegations that it marketed its vaping products to teenagers. The e-cigarette startup, the states claimed, actively courted youth consumers although its wares were “both illegal for them to purchase and are <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/09/09/how-bad-are-e-cigarettes-for-you">unhealthy…to use</a>”. Lawsuits brought against Juul by nine other states continue, as do thousands from individual plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>UN’s</strong> nuclear watchdog called for the “immediate establishment” of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/09/06/how-to-prevent-a-crisis-at-the-zaporizhia-nuclear-power-plant-according-to-a-fukushima-veteran">safety zone</a> around the <strong>Zaporizhia</strong> nuclear station.

China’s currency has suddenly weakened this year after lockdowns hampered exports. The central bank also reduced the amount of foreign currency that Chinese banks need to hold, another sign of its desire to prop up the sliding yuan.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Energy prices</strong> in <strong>California</strong> surged to their highest levels in two years, as residents turned up their air conditioners in the midst of a heatwave in the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/16/the-most-important-river-in-the-american-west-is-drying-up">American West</a>.

<h3>Challenges for Britain’s new prime minister</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/05/what-kind-of-prime-minister-will-liz-truss-be">Liz Truss</a> flew to Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where Queen Elizabeth II invited her to form a new British government. The meeting was secured by the 57.4% of Conservative Party members who picked the current foreign secretary as party leader over her rival, Rishi Sunak.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">That was enough to give Ms Truss the job she craved. But her majority was not as impressive as polling had suggested. She also did worse than her immediate predecessors. Boris Johnson secured 66% of members’ votes in 2019. In 2005 David Cameron scooped 68%.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In an earlier round Ms Truss was backed by just 32% of Tory MPs. Behind Mr Sunak, hers was the lowest share of support of any candidate who has gone on to win since the current rules were introduced in 1998. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/11/who-will-replace-boris-johnson">weak internal mandate</a> is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/07/06/a-monstrous-in-tray-awaits-boris-johnsons-eventual-successor">ominous</a>. Ms Truss will need to lead her increasingly rebellious party through an <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/01/how-to-prevent-europes-energy-crunch-spiralling-into-an-economic-crisis">energy crisis</a> afflicting all of Europe. Recent Tory leaders have had short tenures. Ms Truss will have to work hard to secure her standing among her colleagues.</p>
<h3>Painful reminders for Germany and Israel</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, addressed the German Bundestag on Tuesday. His speech marked the climax of a visit to mark the 50th anniversary of the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches by Palestinian terrorists at the Munich Olympics in 1972.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The run-up to the anniversary was tense. In July victims’ families rejected a German compensation offer and said they would not attend a commemoration ceremony on Monday. After a last-minute deal, including an official apology for security lapses and payments to families, that decision was reversed. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s president, called it “shameful” that it had taken 50 years to reach a settlement.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">After his address, Mr Herzog travelled to the site of the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp. As a soldier in the British army his father, Chaim Herzog, helped to liberate the camp in 1945. The elder Herzog later became the sixth president of Israel. The symbolism of the 11th president’s trip, both personal and political, is clear.</p>
<h3>Rainbow stagnation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">South Africa ought to be the industrial engine of its continent. Yet its economic performance has been disappointing for a decade and a half. Though incomes grew for most people after the end of white rule in 1994, over the past ten years only the top 5% have gained in real terms. That has exacerbated already grotesque inequality.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">So forgive South Africans for greeting its latest GDP figures, for the second quarter of this year, with a shrug. The economy slowed since the previous quarter in large part because firms were hindered by record <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/29/why-the-lights-are-going-out-again-in-south-africa">blackouts</a>, due to the dysfunctional state power company, Eskom. Without reforms to the power monopolist, as well as improvements to the labour market, there will be no huge surge in activity. That is what would be required to put a dent in an unemployment rate of 34%, the highest known rate in the world.</p>
<h3>The end of Australia’s housing boom</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/01/the-global-housing-boom-is-running-out-of-steam">Housing booms</a> in many overheated markets are ending as policymakers raise interest rates to curb inflation. Australia’s market, one of the frothiest, is weathering its sharpest downturn in almost 40 years. Prices nationally have fallen by 3.4% since the central bank started tightening monetary policy in May, according to CoreLogic, a property-data firm. In Sydney house prices are shedding almost A$1,000 ($680) a day.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">That may be only the start. Annual consumer-price inflation is at 6.1%. On Tuesday the Reserve Bank increased interest rates for the fifth consecutive month, by 0.5 percentage points, to 2.35%. Economists reckon that house prices could slump by up to 20% from their peaks. Since some Australian households are among the world’s most indebted, that will hurt. Yet a recession is not yet looming. And even if house prices fell by a fifth, they would still be higher than they were before the pandemic.</p>
<h3>The story of Stewart Brand</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em>, first published in 1968, was an eclectic compendium of tools to help its readers live more sustainable lives. A documentary, released on streaming platforms on Tuesday, about its editor, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/04/06/stewart-brands-belief-in-technology-helped-shape-silicon-valley">Stewart Brand</a>, takes its name from the opening sentence of the <em>Catalog</em>: “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Environmentalists loved the <em>Catalog</em>. But its most enduring impact was in Silicon Valley, where its techno-utopian philosophy took hold. Mr Brand mingled with early computer pioneers, and helped develop the open-source philosophy critical to modern software. Steve Jobs, the late boss of Apple, referred to the periodical as “one of the bibles of my generation.” </p>
<p class="customisedFont">“We Are As Gods” chronicles one of Mr Brand’s more recent projects: using genetic engineering to bring back the woolly mammoth from extinction. To his critics this is hubristic meddling. But with his deep faith in technology, to Mr Brand it is just a new form of conservation.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
