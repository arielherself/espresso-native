<p class="customisedFont">An explosion partially destroyed the only bridge linking Russia and <strong>Crimea</strong>, the peninsula the Kremlin annexed in 2014. Russian officials blamed a bomb carried by a vehicle, though others suggested a more sophisticated attack. The damage is a personal blow to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, who hailed the symbolic importance of the bridge on its inauguration in 2018. The crossing is also an important supply line for Russian forces in southern <strong>Ukraine</strong>. Meanwhile Ukraine’s president, Voldoymyr Zelensky, said on Friday that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/06/ukraine-has-made-stunning-gains-on-the-battlefield">Ukrainian forces recaptured</a> nearly 800 square kilometres of territory in the east this week. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America’s</strong> commerce department imposed <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/01/29/will-china-dominate-the-world-of-semiconductors">new limits</a> on the export of advanced computer <strong>chips</strong> to <strong>China</strong>. Firms will need to acquire a licence to export the chips, which America said China was using to advance its army’s technological prowess and “commit human rights abuses”. China called the move “sci-tech hegemony”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Britain’s</strong> Labour Party, in opposition for 12 years, maintains a substantial lead over the Conservative Party, according to a new poll conducted by YouGov. It recorded support for Labour at 52%, compared with 22% for the Conservatives, adding to pressure on the prime minister, Liz Truss, whose tax-cutting agenda has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/27/the-fallout-from-kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-continues">roiled markets</a> and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/10/05/a-chaotic-conference-fractures-liz-trusss-young-premiership">fractured</a> her party. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Deutsche Bahn</strong>, Germany’s state rail company, said that sabotage had caused disruption of the rail network in the north of the country. The company declined to speculate about who was behind the attack. German authorities are investigating.

<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>New York’s </strong>mayor, Eric Adams, declared a state of emergency to grapple with the city’s sudden <strong>international-migration crisis</strong>. With record numbers of asylum-seekers crossing America’s southern border, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/08/25/americas-border-crisis-reaches-new-york-by-bus">Republican governors have been packing them on coaches</a> with one-way tickets to Democratic-led jurisdictions. Some 17,000 have rocked up in New York since April. Mr Adams said one in five of the city’s homeless are now asylum-seekers.</p>

Among the poor performers was Advanced Micro Devices: its share price tumbled by nearly 14% after the chipmaker cut its forecast for third-quarter revenues by more than $1bn. Levi Strauss shed more than 11% in value after the retailer reported lower-than-expected earnings.</p>

<h3>How long can Ukraine’s winning streak last?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Ukraine’s blistering <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame">counter-offensive</a> has, in recent weeks, left Russian forces in disarray, particularly in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south. But the current <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/06/ukraine-has-made-stunning-gains-on-the-battlefield">wave of liberation</a> will probably soon reach its peak.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This month Ukrainian soldiers in Kherson pushed Russian fighters along the Dnieper river, 30km from the previous front line. And they have continued to make substantial gains in the north of the region. Ukraine’s troops are honing in on parts of northern Luhansk, the only one of the four <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts">annexed regions</a> where Russia enjoys anything close to complete control. They hope to push the Russians back to their positions from before the full-scale invasion.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the window of opportunity may prove short. Russian forces will soon be bolstered by thousands of recently mobilised troops. Though poorly trained, they will supplement Mr Putin’s fight. And the onset of wintery conditions may soon chill the advance.</p>
<h3>Nevada’s nail-biting Senate race</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">One indication of a tight election is whether party bigwigs hit the campaign trail. Nevada has become a runway for wannabe Republican presidential candidates. Donald Trump will head to the state on Saturday to stump for Adam Laxalt and Joe Lombardo, the Republican hopefuls for Senate and governor. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, and various members of Mr Trump’s former cabinet, have also visited the Silver State.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>The Economist</em>’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate/nevada">midterms model</a> suggests <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/10/06/tight-midterm-races-in-nevada-may-hinge-on-outreach-to-latino-voters" data-tegid="6u1shi3hd2qrju0mr8jfd0838r5t952e">Nevada’s Senate race</a> is a toss-up, making it a crucial battleground for control of Congress’s upper chamber. The contest will test whether Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democratic incumbent, can woo Latino voters who <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/07/07/democrats-have-a-hispanic-problem">abandoned her party</a> between 2016 and 2020. Democrats may also discover whether their political machine can endure despite the death of its architect and former Senate majority leader, Harry Reid. Reid’s machine turned Nevada light blue. Come November it may have a different hue.</p>
<h3>The New York Philharmonic returns to Lincoln Centre</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In the late 1950s a working-class black and Hispanic neighbourhood in Manhattan was razed to make way for Lincoln Centre for the Performing Arts. This unsavoury legacy will be addressed when David Geffen Hall—the New York Philharmonic’s home at Lincoln Centre—re-opens on Saturday after a two-year, $550m renovation.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">“San Juan Hill: A New York Story”, an orchestral piece by Etienne Charles, a jazz trumpeter, honours the rich culture of the destroyed neighbourhood, whose residents included Thelonious Monk, a jazz pianist. The upcoming season features music by several living composers, including Cuban-born Tania León and Marcos Balter, a Brazilian.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The hall—long criticised for its subpar acoustics and dreary décor—has been redesigned with amenities that include a giant screen in the lobby to simulcast concerts. These musical and architectural gestures are an attempt to atone for past transgressions and attract the younger and more diverse audience needed to secure the Philharmonic’s future.</p>
<h3>The Women’s Rugby World Cup</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">According to bookmakers, there is little doubt which team will win the Women’s Rugby World Cup, which begins on Saturday in Auckland, New Zealand. Betting $100 on England will win you only $50 if they prevail, such is the recent dominance of the Red Roses. England enter the tournament on an unprecedented 25-match winning streak.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The last two times the team played New Zealand, who are five-time World Cup winners and current holders, England won 43-12 and 56-15. Canada and France, who have been knocked out at the semi-final stage on six occasions, are the other teams with some hope of glory. But it would be a big surprise if the final, on November 12th, were anything other than a repeat of the 2017 event. Five years ago, New Zealand staged a storming second-half comeback, to win 41-32. This time around, England are odds-on to exact their revenge.</p>
<h3>Weekend Profile: Ron DeSantis, the man whom even hurricanes cannot batter</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">As an undergraduate at Yale, Ron DeSantis captained the baseball team. Now Florida’s Republican governor has his mind on home runs of the political sort. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida">Hurricane Ian</a>, which hit his state on September 28th, has left more than 115 Floridians dead and caused up to $57bn in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/10/06/floridas-government-subsidises-people-living-in-hurricane-zones">insured losses</a>. That may make it the second-costliest hurricane to strike America, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But for Mr DeSantis the storm’s wreckage has brought political opportunity, and a chance to demonstrate managerial know-how.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday he appeared alongside Joe Biden, whom he often criticises, as the president surveyed the damage. This time it was all comity. Mr DeSantis thanked him for providing federal aid; Mr Biden said that they had worked “hand in glove”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Disaster management has revealed a fresh side to the governor. Until recently he seemed more interested in lobbing bombs in America’s culture wars. In April, after Disney criticised a state <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/30/why-florida-is-banning-lessons-on-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity">ban on the discussion of sexuality and gender orientation</a> among young children in public-school classrooms, Mr DeSantis hit back. He hastily signed a law <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/what-ron-desantiss-spat-with-disney-says-about-american-politics/21808962">revoking Disney’s “special-district” status</a>, which for decades had allowed the media giant to operate much like a county government at its complex in central Florida. Hammering Democrats for their <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall">perceived weakness on border security</a> is another preoccupation. In September Mr DeSantis chartered private planes with state funds to send Venezuelan migrants in San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, in Massachusetts, an enclave for the wealthy liberals Mr DeSantis loves to taunt.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Those stunts—along with his aversion to lockdowns during the pandemic—have endeared the governor to conservatives. Mr DeSantis is now viewed as a potential rival to Donald Trump, a fellow Florida resident, for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2024. He has fashioned himself in a similar vein, emphasising issues such as election “integrity” and border security, but carries none of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in">former president’s baggage</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ironically it was Mr Trump’s surprise endorsement that helped Mr DeSantis take the governor’s mansion in 2018. That race was close enough to prompt a recount. In November he is expected to breeze to re-election—he commands an 11-point lead over his opponent, Charlie Crist. Now Mr DeSantis is focused on raising his national profile. Hurricane Ian has let him do just that.</p>
