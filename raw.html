<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Reed Hastings</strong> stepped down as chief executive of <strong>Netflix</strong>. He will remain executive chairman of the streaming firm, which he co-founded in 1997 as a mail-order DVD service. Greg Peters, the chief operating officer, will take his place alongside Ted Sarandos, who shared the job with Mr Hastings. Netflix reported a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591">lower-than-expected quarterly profit</a> of $55m, down by 90% from the same period in 2021.

<h3>America’s debt-ceiling madness</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday the American government hit its “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/09/21/what-is-americas-debt-ceiling">debt ceiling</a>”—the upper limit on how much money it can borrow by issuing bonds. The ceiling, a political creation, can be lifted by a simple vote in Congress. That, however, will not happen anytime soon. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Republicans, newly in control of the House of Representatives, demand big cuts to federal spending, including to public-health insurance and other social programmes. The Democrats, who control the Senate, refuse.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For now the Treasury is using special-accounting tactics to ensure that it has money to cover all obligations, from social-insurance outlays to bond payments. Analysts believe these manoeuvres will last until the third quarter, which ends in June. As that deadline nears, global markets will be on edge about the possibility of an American default. Precedent suggests that Congress will reach a last-minute compromise. But given the clout of Republican hardliners, such as those who <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2023/01/04/what-the-kevin-mccarthy-saga-means-for-americas-congress">blocked the appointment </a>of their speaker, the dangers of an accident loom far larger than in the past.</p>
<h3>Protests against French pension reform</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">French commuters are dealing with major disruption on Thursday after every union in the country called for a day of protests, marches and strikes against the government’s plan to raise the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2023/01/10/emmanuel-macron-unveils-his-pension-reforms">legal minimum pension age</a> from 62 to 64. Organisers hope to get 1m people out on the streets. Trains, metros, buses, airports and schools are all affected.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Thanks to a long lifespan and a low average retirement age, the French spend longer in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/05/can-you-afford-to-retire">retirement</a> than pensioners in almost any other OECD country. They are in no mood to give up this privilege. A poll suggests that two-thirds are against raising the pension age to 64.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">President Emmanuel Macron is not around to witness the disturbance, however. He is at a summit in Barcelona, where France and Spain will sign a bilateral treaty to strengthen their friendship. Some of the ministers accompanying him stand ready to return to Paris early, should things get out of hand.</p>
<h3>A new central station in Bangkok</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">South-East Asia’s largest train station opened on Thursday. Officially named Krung Thep Aphiwat (“glory of Bangkok”) Central Terminal, but known as Bang Sue Grand Central, the sleek, undulating terminus in the north of Thailand’s capital has 24 platforms and can handle 600,000 passengers a day. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Until recently Thailand’s railways were notorious for ancient diesel engines and derailments. Bangkok’s previous central station building was completed in 1916. The government hopes investment in its railways will pay off in boosts to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/02/03/south-east-asias-tourism-industry-is-hobbled-by-uncertainty">tourism</a> and reduced road congestion. The new station, which took over a decade to build and cost around $1bn, is part of an explosion of urban transport in Bangkok, as well as being a hub for national and international lines. Bang Sue will serve commuter, long-distance and, eventually, high-speed trains. It will also connect three airports and, later this decade, trains from Kunming in China will stop on route to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Erdogan’s pre-election spending</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Turkish central bankers kept interest rates unchanged at 9% when they met on Thursday. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, is determined to keep the economy growing, and credit flowing, in order to help his chances in elections due to be held on May 14th. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Last year Mr Erdogan pressured the bank to slash interest rates from 14% to 9%. By October inflation had reached 85.5%, stinging the poor and lower-middle classes—Mr Erdogan’s core voters—the hardest. Inflation has since fallen, though only to 64.3%, and the president’s poll numbers are improving. Foreign reserves are being topped up with cash from Russia and Gulf states but the central bank is rapidly spending it to keep the depreciating lira afloat.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In December the government raised the minimum wage by 55%, its third large increase in 2022<strong>.</strong> It also in effect lowered the retirement age, allowing 2m extra Turks to claim their pensions. The opposition sees blatant bids for votes.</p>
<h3>Ronaldo and Messi meet in Saudi Arabia</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday Cristiano Ronaldo, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/11/17/lionel-messi-and-cristiano-ronaldo-have-forged-modern-football">brilliant</a> but fading Portuguese footballer, will play his first match in Saudi Arabia since moving there last year. Mr Ronaldo will captain players from his new club, Al-Nassr, in a friendly against Paris St-Germain. The French team includes his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/game-theory/2015/03/24/the-once-and-future-king" data-tegid="nkttqmnlth4hqpa04d2ee03v4fr4q265">great rival</a>, Lionel Messi, who led Argentina to victory in the World Cup in Qatar. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Ronaldo and Mr Messi are both closely linked with football in the Gulf. PSG is owned by Qatar’s state investment fund, and Mr Messi is a “tourism ambassador” for Saudi Arabia (whose team <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/23/what-saudi-arabias-football-victory-means-for-the-middle-east">beat Argentina</a> in Qatar). </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Saudi government wants to host the World Cup, with Greece and Egypt, in 2030. But the choice of Qatar by football’s governing body was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/11/10/the-world-cup-is-tarnished-should-fans-enjoy-it-anyway">tarnished</a> by corruption. The host had a record of abusing human rights and is so hot that the tournament was held in November and December. Saudi Arabia could pose some of the same problems. FIFA may decide that a different bid is an easier bet.</p>
