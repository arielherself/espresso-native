<p class="customisedFont">Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, rejected Russian calls for a <strong>temporary ceasefire</strong> to mark Orthodox Christmas, calling it a tactical ploy. Vladimir Putin ordered the unilateral ceasefire between noon on Friday and midnight Saturday. The announcement did not include a time zone, but at midday Moscow time fighting was still raging in eastern Ukraine. Separately, <strong>America</strong>,<strong> France</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong> agreed to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2023/01/06/the-west-sends-armoured-fighting-vehicles-to-ukraine">send armoured combat vehicles</a> to Ukraine. America will supply Bradley fighting vehicles, France will send AMX-10RCs and Germany is donating Marders and a Patriot missile-defence system.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Euro-zone inflation </strong>slowed more than anticipated in December, helped by a drop in gas prices. Headline annual inflation fell for a second consecutive month, down from 10.1% in November to 9.2% in December. But core inflation, which omits volatile energy and food prices, rose from 5% to 5.2%, signalling more underlying <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/03/even-recession-may-not-bring-down-europes-inflation">inflationary pressures</a>. François Villeroy de Galhau, France’s central bank governor, warned of further European interest-rate rises.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>American jobs growth</strong> fell in December as high interest rates cooled the labour market, a consequence of the Federal Reserve’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last">ongoing battle</a> against high inflation. America added 223,000 jobs last month, official statistics showed, compared with 256,000 in November. Still, the unemployment rate dipped from 3.6% to 3.5%. That means the Fed is likely to continue its aggressive monetary policy. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Britain’s </strong>government announced a plan to support research into <strong>mRNA vaccines</strong> for cancer treatment, in partnership with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/podcasts/2023/01/04/biontechs-founder-on-the-future-of-mrna-technology" data-tegid="jau1vbkmri091ujkene3c0fe24v7mc6a">BioNTech</a>, a German company that used the technology to create a covid-19 vaccine. The plan aims to accelerate clinical trials for the vaccines, with the goal of delivering treatments to 10,000 patients by 2030. BioNTech’s co-founder, Ozlem Tureci, said that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/12/26/what-if-things-in-britain-go-right-in-2023">Britain</a> was a “great partner” for the project.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Kevin McCarthy is no closer to becoming <strong>Speaker of America’s House of Representatives </strong>after losing an <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2023/01/04/what-the-kevin-mccarthy-saga-means-for-americas-congress">11th vote</a>—making this the most protracted impasse since 1859. Twenty right-wing Republican holdouts have refused to accept his concessions. “The deal is over with him. He does not have the votes,” said Lauren Boebert, one of the rebels. Mr McCarthy needs to win over at least 16. A fourth day of voting is to begin on the second anniversary of the Capitol riot.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">An American warship sailed through the <strong>Taiwan Strait</strong>, sparking ire from China, which <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/will-taiwan-be-the-ukraine-of-asia">claims Taiwan</a> as its territory. <strong>America</strong>, which is committed to helping the self-governing island defend itself, intermittently sends ships through the strait as part of what it considers routine military exercises. China said the latest move undermined the region’s “peace and stability”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Samsung’s </strong>profits in the last quarter of 2022 <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/29/why-some-chipmakers-are-hurting-much-more-than-others">slumped</a> to their lowest level in eight years amid the global economic slowdown. The South Korean electronics giant estimated that earnings sank by 69% year-on-year, to 4.3trn won ($3.4bn). Sales fell across the board but memory chips and smartphones were hit particularly hard. Analysts expect the firm’s profits to shrink further this quarter.</p>

<h3>The divisive anniversary of the Capitol riot</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday President Joe Biden hosts a ceremony at the White House to mark two years since Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/the-insurrection-one-year-on/21807018">reckoning</a> continues after a congressional committee dominated by Democrats published its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/12/23/the-house-delivers-its-800-page-report-on-the-january-6th-riot">800-page investigation</a> into the unrest, which recommended the prosecution of Mr Trump for four federal crimes, including aiding insurrection. A conviction, though unlikely, would bar him from holding federal office again.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In response, some Republicans are proposing to reroute the committee’s evidence away from the National Archives, where it could be stored for decades, to a separate, and newly Republican-controlled, committee. That could lay the groundwork for a counter-report casting the blame elsewhere.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The ongoing divisions make healing harder. At an event last month honouring law-enforcement officers who stepped up on January 6th some refused to shake hands with Republican congressional leaders. And yet neither Mitch McConnell nor <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2023/01/04/what-the-kevin-mccarthy-saga-means-for-americas-congress">Kevin McCarthy</a> has ruled out supporting Mr Trump, should he become their party’s presidential nominee in 2024.</p>
<h3>Europe’s cooling inflation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A new year heatwave brought respite from winter frost in Europe—temperatures reached 25°C in Bilbao—and tumbling gas prices offer further relief. They are now lower than on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That will bolster the efforts of the European Central Bank to bring down inflation, too. Euro-zone <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/21/2022-has-been-a-year-of-brutal-inflation">inflation</a> figures for December, published on Friday, show that some progress has been made.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The new numbers suggest that headline inflation has probably peaked in Europe. Annual inflation slowed from 10.1% in November, compared with the previous year, to 9.2% in December. Still, strip away volatile energy prices, and inflation is still rising, from 7% to 7.2%. Peaking headline inflation is a relief, but the enduring effects of the post-pandemic bout of inflation and tight labour markets will be a tough nut to crack for the ECB.</p>
<h3>America’s annual economic gabfest</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Economists will gather in New Orleans this weekend for the annual meeting of the American Economic Association (AEA), the premier society for scholars of the dismal science. The profession has had a bruising couple of years after its models failed to predict surging <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/03/does-high-inflation-matter">inflation</a>. Attendees will pore over new evidence on the drivers of prices, and analyse the pros and cons of the economic policies pursued during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The AEA also faces mounting tension internally. The economics profession is confronting a resurgence of #MeToo-style <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/08/tackling-sexual-harassment-could-bring-sizeable-economic-dividends">allegations of sexual misconduct</a> by male professors. At the same time, conservative academics grumble that the association has become excessively focused on research regarding progressive social causes. Meanwhile, newly minted PhDs, who in the past would attend scores of interviews with academic departments during the event, now get hired online. And strangely, physical attendees of the AEA are still required to wear masks—a decision that seems unlikely to have passed a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<h3>Rishi Sunak’s winter of discontent</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In Britain, nothing much is moving. A <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/11/03/britain-faces-a-wave-of-industrial-action-this-winter">winter of strikes</a> grinds on in the public sector. On Friday railway workers in the RMT union, and civil servants in agencies handling driving licences, farm payments and highway management, are all off work in protest. Later this month walkouts are also planned by unions representing <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/12/19/british-nurses-launch-unprecedented-strikes">nurses</a>, teachers and bus workers. The proximate cause for the strikes is pay settlements failing to keep up with inflation, but they follow years of low morale and pay constraints in much of the state sector.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Taming the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/12/13/the-british-government-and-the-unions-dig-in-on-train-strikes">endless strikes</a> is a major task for Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister. He hopes that tackling inflation, which he says he will halve in a year (roughly economists’ consensus forecast), will take some pressure off wage demands. But in the meantime, he needs to keep the country running. A new anti-strike law designed to maintain a minimum level of service in key sectors during strikes is in the works.</p>
<h3>Iceland remakes “Perfect Strangers”</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2023/01/03/perfect-strangers-has-been-remade-more-than-20-times-since-2016">“Perfect Strangers”</a>, an Italian box-office hit from 2016, old friends gathered for dinner to play a game: each pledges to share any incoming phone call or text message with the whole group. The friends claim they have nothing to hide. Yet the exercise reveals love affairs, an accidental pregnancy and closeted homosexuality.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The film has since been remade in more than 20 countries—perhaps the highest tally in history. The latest, from Iceland, is released on Friday. What makes “Perfect Strangers” the perfect remake? Its theme of reliance on personal technology and expectations of privacy cuts across cultures, whether considered over gnocchi or reindeer.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Notably absent, however, is an English-language remake. The rights to “Perfect Strangers” have only recently been freed up when the film company of the imprisoned Harvey Weinstein became defunct. Hollywood often exports its remakes, which dissuades other countries from releasing their own. But this time it has left a gap in the market.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 GMT on Friday to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@economist.com"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cf9ebaa6b58abcbfbdaabcbca08faaaca0a1a0a2a6bcbbe1aca0a2">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown one winner per continent on Saturday.</p>
