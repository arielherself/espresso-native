<p class="customisedFont">The World Health Organisation warned that <strong>Ukraine</strong> faces a “devastating energy crisis” <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/11/01/keeping-ukraine-from-freezing-this-winter">this winter</a>. That will severely test the country’s health service, which lacks fuel, water and electricity. Some 10m people, a quarter of the population, do not have access to power as Russian strikes have halved the country’s generating capacity. The country’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, asked Ukrainians to conserve energy, with power cuts expected until March. As winter temperatures in Ukraine fall below -20°C (-4°F), local authorities told citizens in Kherson, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/11/17/ukraine-has-momentum-what-it-needs-now-are-munitions">recently-liberated Ukrainian city</a> with severely damaged infrastructure, that they may be evacuated to other regions.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The king of <strong>Malaysia </strong>started the process of choosing the country’s <strong>next prime minister</strong>. It had been hoped that elections on Saturday would produce a democratic mandate. Failing that—a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/11/21/a-hung-parliament-in-malaysia-augurs-more-bad-government-and-instability">hung parliament</a> was elected instead—the incumbent coalition might have sided with either of its rivals and played the kingmaker. But on Tuesday it declined, leaving that job to the king himself.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Italy’s</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-allies-take-power-in-italy">right-wing government</a> agreed its first budget, which includes a windfall tax of 35% on the profits of energy companies until mid-2023. The spending plan for €35bn ($36bn), which earmarks funds to fight high energy prices, will be predominantly funded through borrowing. But the target deficit of 4.5% of GDP next year has assuaged fears of the high-debt country colliding with the EU.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Crypto’s </strong>crisis continued.<strong> Genesis</strong>, a cryptocurrency lender, tried to reassure its creditors that it has “no plans to file bankruptcy imminently”—the firm was forced to suspend redemptions after the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars">collapse of FTX</a>. And American prosecutors indicted two Estonians for allegedly defrauding investors of $575m through a crypto-fuelled Ponzi scheme. <strong>Bitcoin</strong> meanwhile sank to $15,800—a quarter of its price three years ago.</p>

At least 162 people were killed, with dozens of buildings levelled in the hilly Cianjur regency, 75km from Jakarta. On Tuesday morning an underwater 7.0-magnitude earthquake thousands of kilometres to the east briefly raised the spectre of a tsunami in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Bob Chapek</strong>, who was sacked as CEO of <strong>Disney</strong> on Sunday, was the victim of a boardroom revolt, according to several reports. A campaign to oust Mr Chapek had apparently been running since the summer, led by senior executives who were unhappy at his leadership. He oversaw huge streaming losses and a plummeting share price. Bob Iger, Disney’s previous, long-time boss, has been <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/21/disney-brings-back-a-star-of-the-past-but-its-real-problem-is-the-script">reinstalled</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Iran’s</strong> footballers staged a silent protest against the country’s brutal regime by refusing to sing the national anthem ahead of their <strong>World Cup </strong>opener against England in Qatar. Before the game Ehsan Hajsafi, the captain, suggested his team could be the voice for hundreds of families left bereaved by a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/films/2022/11/08/is-iran-on-the-edge-of-a-revolution">murderous crackdown</a> on political protests.

<h3>Kamala Harris showboats in the Philippines</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s vice-president is in the Philippines. After meeting on Monday with the country’s president, Ferdinand Marcos junior, on Tuesday Kamala Harris visited Palawan, an island on the front line of a struggle for maritime dominance. It is to the west and north of Palawan that America’s navy conducts “freedom of navigation” missions around the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/01/15/china-does-not-have-it-all-its-way-in-the-south-china-sea">disputed South China Sea</a>, most of which China claims as its own. China and the Philippines also squabble over fishing and oil-and-gas rights within the 200-nautical-mile Philippine “exclusive economic zone”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">To manage the Chinese navy, coastguard and fishing fleet without overly riling it, the Philippines deploys its civilian coastguard rather than its (rather feeble) navy. Ms Harris’s visit included a spell aboard such a Philippine boat, albeit safely outside waters claimed by China. That was intended to communicate America’s readiness to help the Philippines defend itself from armed attack. China, irked by such commitments, may find a way to signal its disapproval for Ms Harris’s showboating.</p>
<h3>EU economies brace for a fall</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">There is a bout of optimism around the EU economies these days. Quarterly GDP figures released last week were not as bad as expected, employment continued to grow and, crucially, energy prices on wholesale markets have come down from their summer highs. On Tuesday the OECD, an intergovernmental research body, added its relatively optimistic assessment of Europe’s economic outlook.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The club projects the euro-zone economy in 2023 to grow on par with America, at 0.5%. But <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/investors-are-becoming-too-optimistic-about-the-world-economy">elation</a> may be premature. Energy prices have fallen but remain high. Long-term contracts with gas and electricity suppliers have cushioned the blow this year—but in 2023 the full effect of energy price rises will be felt.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A second worry is the hit to the incomes of European households. Post-pandemic savings buoyed consumption, and the risk of unemployment remains low. But that may not last either. The billions of euros Europe’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/01/europe-scrambles-to-protect-consumers-against-dizzying-energy-prices">governments</a> have dispensed to firms and households may not prevent Europe from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/31/europe-is-heading-for-recession-how-bad-will-it-be">tumbling into recession</a>.</p>
<h3>Iranians continue their lethal protest</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Death has galvanised protest for more than two months in Iran. Unrest began in mid-September when <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2022/09/28/im-the-same-as-mahsa-and-i-want-my-freedom-anger-at-irans-regime-spills-onto-the-streets">Mahsa Amini</a>, a young woman detained by the morality police, died in custody. Whenever protests seemed to ebb, more killings sent people back to the streets. So it was in recent days, after Kian Pirfalak, a nine-year-old boy, was shot by security forces. His funeral drew large crowds.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The regime has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/by-invitation/2022/11/16/shirin-ebadi-on-the-legal-obstacles-irans-protesters-face">arrested thousands</a> and issued a handful of death sentences. In the past week it detained two actresses who removed their headscarves in public. But it has not been able to stop the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/17/irans-protesters-are-painting-for-freedom">scattered, leaderless unrest</a>. There have been periodic strikes across the country, including in Tehran’s famed bazaar. Before their opening World Cup match against England on Monday Iran’s team refused to sing the national anthem. Ehsan Hajsafi, the captain, has already said he “sympathises” with the protesters—an act of defiance on the world’s biggest stage.</p>
<h3>Cyril Ramaphosa visits Britain</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">King Charles III hosts his first state visit as Britain’s monarch on Tuesday. It will offer his guest, Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, welcome respite from <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/06/23/allegations-of-impropriety-weaken-south-africas-president">politics at home</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">For on Tuesday Mr Ramaphosa will also learn how many nominations he has received to continue leading South Africa’s ruling African National Congress, ahead of a vote at the party’s national conference next month. Although he is expected to have a solid lead over his rivals, the ANC has acquired a habit of defenestrating sitting presidents.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Ramaphosa may enjoy discussing with the King shared interests such as wildlife and the environment. His conversations with Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, on Wednesday will be less convivial. Britain is unhappy with South Africa’s refusal to condemn Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Ramaphosa, in turn, is expected to press for Britain and its allies to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe and to offer Africa more aid and investment to deal with climate change.</p>
<h3>The history of an American siege</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In “American Caliph”, a book published on Tuesday, Shahan Mufti, an American journalist, tells the extraordinary, and largely forgotten, story of what is still the largest-ever hostage-taking in America.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 1977 the Hanafi Movement, a black Muslim group based in Washington, DC, took nearly 150 people hostage in three buildings near the White House. The siege, masterminded by Hamaas Abdul Khaalis—who styled himself as an American Caliph or leader of America’s Muslims—was intended to stop the release of a film Hanafis considered blasphemous, and as revenge for the murder of several members of Khaalis’s family by the Nation of Islam, a rival group. Two hostages died.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Mufti weaves wider historical events into his story, such as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/prospero/2016/02/03/when-muhammad-met-malcolm">Malcolm X’s</a> assassination and new laws that facilitated Muslim immigration to America. These elements supply the rich context of a saga that builds in tension until the last gripping moments. The reader is left wondering how this extraordinary tale could have been neglected for so long.</p>
