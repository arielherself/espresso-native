<p class="customisedFont">Russian missiles targeted <strong>energy infrastructure</strong> in multiple Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian officials said a power-supply facility outside the capital, Kyiv, had been hit. A facility in the Zaporizhia region was hit by <strong>drones</strong>, according to the regional governor. Several EU foreign ministers called for fresh sanctions against<strong> Iran</strong> over its transfer of such <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/why-drones-are-becoming-irans-weapons-of-choice/21806199">“kamikaze” drones</a> to <strong>Russia</strong>. Britain and France were joined by America in complaining that Iran and Russia violated terms of the UN Security Council resolution that endorsed the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/23/what-is-the-jcpoa-the-deal-meant-to-restrict-irans-nuclear-activity">nuclear deal of 2015</a> (which America scotched in 2018).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Liz Truss, <strong>Britain’s</strong> prime minister, apologised for “mistakes” in her signature economic programme. Almost all of the tax measures announced in her fateful “mini-budget” were reversed on Monday. The U-turn calmed the market but did not repair all the damage. The Bank of England has reportedly been forced to postpone its sale of government bonds until conditions improve. Thirty-year gilt yields remain well over 4%; they were 3.75% before the budget announcement.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The S&amp;P 500 share index climbed by 2.7% on Monday, boosted by stronger-than-expected earnings at <strong>Bank of America</strong>. Quarterly revenues at America’s second-largest leapt by 8% year over year, though profits declined. As interest rates rise, banks are enjoying the spread between the cost of borrowing and lending. At BoA this net interest income was up by 24%.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> postponed indefinitely the release of third-quarter GDP data, an official telling Reuters that the delay was “due to adjustment to work arrangements” without providing further details. The figures were due to be published on Tuesday. Analysts expected the data to reveal weak growth because of the zero-covid policy and a property-sector slump. Speaking at the ongoing <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/10/16/at-chinas-communist-party-congress-xi-jinping-sails-on-undaunted">Chinese Communist Party congress</a>, Li Keqiang, the prime minister, insisted that the economy is recovering.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>France</strong> faced nationwide disruption on Tuesday as eight unions as well as students began a strike over pay and rising corporate profits. Transport, waste collection, schools and universities were all affected. This latest wave of industrial action will compound President Emmanuel Macron’s difficulties. Weeks-long strikes at France’s fuel facilities have led to shortages and long queues at petrol stations.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>China</strong> is planning <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/special-report/2022/10/10/china-has-chilling-plans-for-governing-taiwan">unification</a> with <strong>Taiwan</strong> on a “much faster timeline” than previously thought, according to Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state. Mr Blinken suggested China may achieve unification by force, but said America would honour its commitment to help Taiwan defend itself. On Sunday <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/10/17/no-turning-back-for-xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a>, China’s president, said “complete reunification of our country must and will be realised”.</p>

<h3>How to defeat kamikaze drones</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s army plans this week to publish a request to weapons manufacturers for better technologies to defeat loitering munitions, known as kamikaze or suicide drones. Recent Russian attacks on Ukraine with an Iranian-made drone, the Shahed-136, including deadly volleys launched at Kyiv on Monday, have shown just how destructive they can be. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Shahed (“martyr” in Persian) is not exactly stealthy. Ukrainians call them “flying mopeds”. Ukraine claims its armed forces have shot down 75% of the drones launched by Russia during this war. Some have even been destroyed with small arms. But kamikaze drones are relatively cheap and so continue to be used often.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">America’s Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office (JCO) will issue the request for better countermeasures. The systems should be able to stop kamikaze drones that weigh between 25-600kg. Defence contractors must meet what one JCO official has called “an aggressive timeline”; they aim to finish testing the kit within a year. Proposals with lasers and microwave jammers are expected.</p>
<h3>Florida’s Senate candidates debate</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Tuesday night Florida’s Republican senator, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/special-report/2022/03/30/two-elections-will-attract-national-interest">Marco Rubio</a>, will face his Democratic challenger, Val Demings, in a debate. The state’s race is worth watching, and not just because it could decide control of the Senate.<br/><br/> Mr Rubio is a Cuban-American who has served in the Senate since 2011. Ms Demings is an African-American congresswoman. Her nomination signals a shift by the Democrats towards more <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/07/14/democrats-in-america-are-realising-they-must-moderate-or-die">moderate candidates</a>. As a former police chief she can push back against his claims that she is “dangerously radical”. The race also highlights the attention and money pouring into the Sunshine State. Mr Rubio has raised around $40m and Ms Demings around $50m. But <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida">Hurricane Ian</a> has complicated their campaigns not least because President Joe Biden praised the clean-up efforts of Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor running for re-election.<br/><br/> Polls show Mr Rubio ahead of Ms Demings by nearly five points. In the debate he will argue that Florida is a former swing state that has permanently shifted toward Republicans. Voters on November 8th will test that claim.</p>

<h3>Netflix is swayed by advertising</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“There’s not easy money there,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix’s boss, explaining in 2020 why the world’s biggest streaming service would avoid the advertising business. So why will Mr Hastings spend an earnings call on Tuesday telling investors that, in fact, advertising is just what Netflix needs?</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The company’s recent share performance explains the U-turn. In 2020-21, when Netflix added 40m subscribers amid <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/27/covid-19-is-a-short-term-boon-to-streaming-services">covid-19 lockdowns</a>, the company’s stock soared. But this year <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/netflix-sheds-subscribers-and-170bn-in-market-value/21808847">subscriptions have stalled</a> and investors have fled. Netflix shares have fallen by two-thirds since November, torching nearly $200bn in market value.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Can ads turn things around? At $15.49 a month in America, Netflix’s standard plan is the priciest of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591">main streamers</a>. By contrast its $6.99 ads-included plan, launching next month, will undercut rivals such as Disney+ and HBO Max. Cost-conscious households may downgrade or sign back up. But as Mr Hastings knows, there’s no longer any easy money in streaming.</p>
<h3>The BBC’s 100th birthday</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The British Broadcasting Corporation is a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/10/13/the-bbc-marks-its-100th-birthday">hundred years old</a> on Tuesday. For a century, it has parcelled up triumph and disaster then distributed them to the British and around the world. During the cold war it even had a recording ready for use in a nuclear apocalypse. “This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons,” announces a silken-voiced newsreader on the now-released recording. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In its early days the BBC employed no journalists. “There is no news,” ran one crisp bulletin in 1930. Today it broadcasts in 42 languages to 492m people and its news is trusted worldwide. That contributed to a hugely successful <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/01/29/a-history-of-the-bbc-makes-for-a-fine-history-of-the-british">first century</a> for the organisation nicknamed “aunty”. But its second will probably be <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/in-its-centenary-year-the-bbc-looks-vulnerable">less so</a>. A fifth of British young people watch no BBC content at all. Arguing that all British households who watch television should pay an annual licence fee of £159 ($180) per year, which funds the BBC, will thus become more difficult. This is a birthday with a less than celebratory feel.</p>
<h3>The hauntingly beautiful tale of “Till”</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">A new film tells the story of a racially motivated killing remembered as one of the darkest incidents of segregated America. “Till,” which was released in America on Friday, portrays the horrific <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2019/11/14/memories-of-emmett-till">murder</a> of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black boy, in Mississippi in 1955. His two white killers were later acquitted. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Rather than focus solely on the abduction, torture and shooting of Till, the film centres on the victim’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley. She frets over his trip from Chicago to segregated <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2019/11/14/memories-of-emmett-till">Mississippi</a>, learns of his death, endures the trial of his killers and eventually becomes a civil-rights campaigner. Danielle Deadwyler delivers a strong performance as Mamie. She is joined by many well known black actors; Whoopi Goldberg plays her mother. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Chinonye Chukwu, the director, handles the toughest moments, including a full-body shot of Emmett Till’s mangled and bloated body, with sensitivity. The film is worth viewing, both for its historical import as well as for its artistry.</p>
