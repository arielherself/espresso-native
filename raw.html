<p class="customisedFont">Wall Street slumped at the prospect that further <strong>unrest</strong> in <strong>China</strong> and rising covid-19 cases would slow its economy. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each shed 1.5%. After tens of thousands of Chinese people <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows">rallied</a> against the country’s draconian <strong>anti-covid measures</strong>, the White House affirmed their “right to peacefully protest”. The number of new infections reported in China hit a record 40,000.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine’s </strong>president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that residents of the southern <strong>Kherson </strong>region endured 258 rounds of Russian shelling this past week alone. Millions of people have only limited access to electricity, water and heat after Russian missiles pulverised much of Ukraine’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/11/23/in-ukraine-living-as-normal-is-an-act-of-defiance">energy infrastructure</a>, including a pumping station providing water to Mykolaiv, a city north of Kherson. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>BlockFi</strong>, a crypto lender, filed for bankruptcy. The firm, valued at $4bn dollars at one point last year, failed to recover from the collapse of FTX, the crypto-trading platform that also <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars">went bankrupt</a> earlier this month. Separately, <strong>Kraken</strong>, another crypto exchange, agreed to pay more than $360,000 to America’s treasury department for allowing transactions with users in Iran, in violation of sanctions.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Talks between <strong>America </strong>and <strong>Russia </strong>on the “New START” treaty—meant to regulate their arsenals of <strong>strategic missiles</strong>—were postponed the day before they were due to start. America blamed Russia, accusing it of “unilaterally” calling off the summit scheduled to take place in Cairo, Egypt’s capital. The decision comes amid months of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear">nuclear threats</a> from President Vladimir Putin in response to Western support for Ukraine.</p>

<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> unveiled plans to build a mammoth airport with six runways in Riyadh, the capital. It will serve as the hub for a yet-to-be-launched state airline called RIA to compete with Emirates, which is based in Dubai. The kingdom is keen to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/the-reinvention-of-the-saudi-economy-is-going-slower-than-planned/21806192">wean its economy off oil</a> and boost tourism—the airport will be able to accommodate 120m passengers by 2030, if all goes to plan.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Shell </strong>agreed to buy Europe’s largest <strong>biogas</strong> producer for nearly $2bn as it <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2021/10/30/an-activist-investor-targets-shell">expands into renewables</a>. Nature Energy, based in Denmark, produces biomethane, which is chemically identical to natural gas but is made from organic waste. In October BP, another oil major, agreed to pay more than $4bn for Archaea Energy, an American biogas producer.<strong></strong></p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Football World Cup: Brazil</strong> scored in the 83rd minute to beat Switzerland 1-0.

Another superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, claimed credit for <strong>Portugal’s</strong> opening goal in its 2-0 win against Uruguay; in fact Bruno Fernandes was responsible for both goals.</p>

<h3>Fury mounts over lockdowns in China</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Residents of China’s cities return to work on Monday after a weekend of widespread protests against draconian “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/11/17/china-tweaks-its-zero-covid-policy">zero-covid</a>” measures. Frustrations with months of lockdowns spread after a fire in Urumqi, in the western region of Xinjiang, left ten dead on Thursday. Many blamed covid restrictions for hindering fire-fighters and occupants who were trying to escape. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Saturday night demonstrators in Shanghai called for President Xi Jinping to step down—an extremely rare show of defiance. On Sunday night in Beijing crowds sang the “Internationale”, a socialist anthem, and mourned the deaths in Xinjiang. Students at several university campuses held up blank sheets of paper to highlight China’s lack of free speech. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">China’s rulers hate instability. But they are in a bind. The country is gripped by its biggest covid outbreak yet. Elderly people are made more vulnerable by low vaccination rates. Many Chinese people are clearly furious with public-health rules. Reintroducing restrictions will probably spark more unrest.</p>
<h3>In with the old at Disney</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Staff of the Magic Kingdom will gather on Monday morning for a virtual town-hall meeting with Bob Iger, who began a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/21/disney-brings-back-a-star-of-the-past-but-its-real-problem-is-the-script">second stint as chief executive</a> a week ago. Mr Iger ran Disney for 15 stellar years before stepping down in 2020. His successor, Bob Chapek, had a tougher time and was booted out on November 20th after quarterly results showed growing losses at Disney+, the company’s streaming service. Mr Iger will now try to steady the ship in two years.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Investors are glad to have him back: Disney’s stock has risen since his return. And staff are mostly pleased that Mr Iger is undoing a centralising strategy initiated by Mr Chapek, handing power back to Disney’s creative teams. But the difficulties at Disney, and across Hollywood, run deeper. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591">Streaming</a> is undermining the cinema and cable industries and turning out to be less profitable than either. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/11/23/what-disney-can-learn-from-elton-john">new-old Bob</a> will need more than new-old ideas.</p>
<h3>Judicial nominees on the Senate’s agenda</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Monday America’s Senate returns from its Thanksgiving break to debate the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/politics/same-sex-marriage-bill-senate.html">Respect for Marriage Act</a>, a bill that would strengthen rights for same-sex couples. It will also consider some <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/executive_calendar/xcalv.pdf">two dozen nominees</a> for judgeships on federal courts and may hold votes on two district-court nominees.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Both are women: Camille Vélez-Rivé in Puerto Rico and Anne Nardacci in New York. That is consistent with President Joe Biden’s previous appointments: of the 85 judges he has seated so far, including Ketanji Brown Jackson on the Supreme Court, just 21 are men. Nearly a quarter are African-American and two-thirds are non-white.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The Democrats’ marginal majority in the Senate allowed Mr Biden to rapidly usher nominees into robes. If Raphael Warnock beats Herschel Walker (the Republican candidate) in a run-off election for Georgia’s seat on December 6th, Democrats will walk away from the midterms with 51 seats to the Republicans’ 49 (meaning Kamala Harris, the vice-president, will no longer be needed to break ties). This could speed things up further—and embolden Mr Biden to put forward more progressive nominees.</p>
<h3>The “real election” gets going in Chicago</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Monday is the last day when candidates can file to run for mayor of Chicago—dubbed the “real election” by locals after the midterms. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/04/03/lori-lightfoot-becomes-chicagos-first-black-female-mayor">Lori Lightfoot</a>, the incumbent, is expected to wait until the last moment to do so. To participate, hopefuls must present at least 12,500 signatures from registered voters. The most successful traditionally manage many times that. In the sixties Richard J Daley, perhaps the most powerful American mayor, filed 500,000.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Lightfoot, who sees herself as a successor to Harold Washington, the city’s first black mayor, once said she had “the biggest dick in Chicago”. But she faces a tough re-election campaign, having come under fire for her policies on crime and policing, and her supposed neglect of the downtown. She will also be competing with at least six other candidates, including Jesús “Chuy” Garcia, a combative Mexican-American congressman. Chicago was once famous for “machine politics”, but established politicians can no longer mechanically turn out blocks of votes like before. This election is anyone’s game. </p>
<h3>AI outplays humans, again</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Artificial intelligence has already trounced humans at backgammon, chess and Go. Now it can routinely win at Diplomacy, which for some aficionados is a truer marker of game-playing ability. Diplomacy, which sees players scrap for control of a pre-first world war Europe, is a very human pastime. Play demands collaboration but also allows for double-crossing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">In a paper recently published in <em>Science</em>, researchers at Meta—Facebook’s parent company—explain how they created Cicero, a program that could play Diplomacy, and win. (It ranked in the top 10% of players in an online multi-game tournament.) Like all AI game-playing projects, Cicero learnt through reinforcement: making more selective moves as it was rewarded for positive outcomes.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Diplomacy also requires players to communicate with others well enough to implement their chosen strategy, whether treacherous or truthful. Thus Cicero also had to be trained to speak like a human player, using vast sets of language data. That it did so successfully proves an ability to negotiate, convince, co-operate and compete. </p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 BST on <strong>Friday</strong> to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#baebcfd3c0ffc9cac8dfc9c9d5fadfd9d5d4d5d7d3c9ce94d9d5d7"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="92c3e7fbe8d7e1e2e0f7e1e1fdd2f7f1fdfcfdfffbe1e6bcf1fdff">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown one winner per continent on Saturday.</p>
