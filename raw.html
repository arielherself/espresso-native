<h3>America and Japan buddy up in defence</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, visits the White House. His meeting with Joe Biden bookends a whirlwind tour of countries, including France, Italy, Britain and Canada, as Japan prepares to host a G7 summit in Hiroshima in May. In Washington, climate and trade issues, especially American curbs on semiconductor exports to China, will be on the agenda. But the two leaders will also focus on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/09/15/war-in-ukraine-has-bolstered-japans-support-for-a-stronger-army">security</a>. On Wednesday their governments announced a commitment to strengthen their bilateral security alliance, faced with an increasingly assertive China. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">This move comes at a time of upheaval for Japan’s security policy. Under a plan released in December, the country will nearly double its defence spending and acquire new weapons systems, including long-range missiles. The Biden administration has praised the initiative, seeing Japan’s build-up as essential to deterring Chinese aggression. And thus a means to ensure the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2023/01/04/reinventing-the-indo-pacific">security of the Indo-Pacific</a>.</p>
<h3>The calm before the storm for America’s banks</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On the surface, the ripples look calm enough. Four of America’s biggest lenders—Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo—report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Friday. The expectation is that they, along with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/18/goldman-sachss-disastrous-main-street-gamble">Goldman Sachs</a> and Morgan Stanley who report next week, will make a similar level of profit as they did in the second or third quarters of 2022.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet those gentle undulations hide a frantic churn in bank-business revenues. Net interest income—the money banks collect on loans, less the money they pay out on deposits—is soaring as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Meanwhile, the risk of a slowing economy may force borrowers to default, so banks are setting aside loan-loss provisions. The shock of much higher interest rates has killed off dealmaking activity, while leading to banner years for trading desks. These pressures are expected to balance out for now. But choppier waters may lie ahead.</p>
<h3>Germany’s economy slightly rebounds</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday Germany’s statistics agency announced that the country’s economy expanded by 1.9% in 2022. This was more than analysts expected, but slower than the increase of 2.6% recorded last year, one of the most difficult for the German economy in recent history. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine radically reduced Russian deliveries of natural gas to Germany; in 2021 Russia accounted for over half of German gas imports. A rapid increase in energy prices, as well as post-pandemic challenges like supply-chain bottlenecks, posed a serious threat to Germany’s manufacturing-heavy economic model.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet so far the economy has weathered the storm thanks to the government’s fiscal support and milder weather that has kept energy prices down. Even so, in early 2023 Germany is expected to slip into recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But it is expected to be mild, as is the downturn in the rest of the euro zone.</p>
<h3>How to change Indian palates</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For Hindus, the middle of January is an auspicious time. Makar Sankranti, a festival that marks the end of the winter solstice—known as “Pongal” in south India—falls this weekend. For millions of Indian farmers it is an occasion to celebrate harvests past while praying for more bountiful ones to come. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Rice and wheat are India’s traditional staples. But <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/02/05/indias-government-and-its-greens-disagree-on-what-counts-as-forest">India’s government</a> is hoping to change that. It pushed the UN to declare 2023 the International Year of Millets. At home, it is organising events to increase consumption and production of cereals. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Their reasoning is sound. Millets, a name given to a range of small-grained cereals, require far less water than rice and wheat. They also provide more protein and fibre. Yet they remain largely unfashionable with the Indian population. Per-person consumption of millets has fallen in recent decades, as urbanisation changed consumer tastes. The government may struggle to convert Indian palates.</p>
<h3>A new film tackles race and gender in France</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“Saint Omer”, France’s entry for this year’s Oscars, is released in America on Friday. To describe it simply as a courtroom drama is to overlook the subtle study of motherhood, race, separation and belonging at the centre of this first feature film by Alice Diop, a French director born to Senegalese parents in the suburbs of Paris. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The movie follows the trial of Laurence Coly (Guslagie Malanda), a Senegalese woman studying in Paris. She admits to leaving her baby daughter on a beach in northern France to be carried away by the tide and is accused of murder. The story unfolds through the eyes of Rama (Kayije Kagame), a writer whose parents also come from Senegal. The trial awakens in Rama the pain of her own maternal relationship as well as her bi-cultural anxiety, peeling back layers of racial and cultural prejudice. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Diop has already won gongs at the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/prospero/2017/09/05/why-it-is-significant-that-venice-film-festival-put-vr-on-the-bill">Venice Film Festival</a> for “Saint Omer”, which is based on a true story. It is an artful account of the immigrant experience in France. And of motherhood everywhere.</p>
