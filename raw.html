<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America </strong>shot down a <strong>Chinese</strong> balloon over the Atlantic in what the Pentagon said was American airspace. The Chinese government responded with a sharp statement accusing the Biden administration of “seriously violating international conventions”. Earlier, Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2023/02/04/the-sino-american-rivalry-needs-guardrails-to-contain-small-incidents">postponed</a> a planned trip to China after the Pentagon detected the suspected spy balloon flying over sensitive military sites. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Iran</strong>’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed to have pardoned “tens of thousands” of prisoners including some arrested in recent anti-government protests. The death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman arrested in September for not wearing a “proper” headscarf, sparked daily protests. To <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/12/protests-have-subsided-in-iran-but-clerics-cannot-yet-proclaim-victory">quell demonstrations</a> the authorities locked up nearly 20,000 people, sentencing over a hundred to death.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that conditions on <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2023/02/01/ukraines-troops-in-the-east-are-quietly-confident">the eastern front</a> are becoming tougher as fighting rages in Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Lyman, three contested cities in the province of <strong>Donetsk</strong>. Meanwhile <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2023/01/25/a-minister-is-sacked-in-ukraine-as-corruption-allegations-swirl">Oleksii Reznikov</a>, the country’s defence minister, said that new long-range missiles being supplied by foreign countries would not be used to hit Russia territory. On Friday America promised a rocket which would double Ukraine’s strike range.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Avalanches in <strong>Austria </strong>and <strong>Switzerland </strong>killed ten people in apline ski resorts this weekend. Following intense snowfall and wind Austria put in place a level four avalanche alert, the second highest, meaning “very large avalanches are likely” and advising skiers to keep to official runs.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>General Pervez Musharraf</strong>, a former president of <strong>Pakistan</strong> who seized power in a military coup in 1999, died aged 79. Mr Musharraf oversaw a period of rapid economic growth, but was criticised by some for using the military to silence critics and for supporting America’s post-9/11 “war on terror”. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2013/06/29/the-general-in-the-dock">Mr Musharraf</a> left office in 2008 and spent his later years in exile in Dubai.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Foxconn</strong>, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer with factories in China, reported record revenues of T$660bn ($22bn) in January, an increase of 48% year-on-year.

<h3>Endless paralysis in Lebanon</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">After the crime comes the cover-up. The investigation of the massive explosion at Beirut’s port in 2020, which killed 218 people, was stalled for more than a year by legal challenges. Tarek Bitar, the judge overseeing it, had hoped to resume interrogating officials on Monday. Instead he has been charged with judicial misconduct by Lebanon’s top prosecutor—one of the officials whom Mr Bitar had sought to question.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The judicial feud is yet another sign of Lebanon’s dysfunction. It has not had a president since October, and parliament has failed 11 times to elect a new one. Last year the caretaker cabinet went six months without meeting. More than three years into a financial crisis, Lebanon’s currency has lost 97% of its value. Annual inflation was 171% in 2022. Bailout talks with the IMF are stalled. Lebanon’s corrupt ruling class cannot agree on anything, it seems, except their collective taste for impunity.</p>
<h3>What’s at stake in Cyprus</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Greek Cypriots hold a presidential election on Sunday. The front-runner is Nikos Christodoulides, who resigned last month as foreign minister because rivals in the ruling party were angry about his presidential ambitions. Mr Christodoulides, now an independent backed by left-of-centre parties, is unlikely to get more than 50% of the vote (as are the other 13 candidates). But he should win a run-off on February 12th. Turkish Cypriots living in the north of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2021/11/18/putting-cyprus-together-may-be-impossible">divided island </a>will not participate.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">One of Mr Christodoulides’s main challenges will be to manage the complex <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets">energy politics</a> of the eastern Mediterranean. Several international companies plan to start exploiting natural gas from the Cypriot seabed. Israel and Egypt are already exploring their own such deposits, while Turkey has failed to make any finds so far. Cyprus could sell gas to Egypt, some of which could be re-exported to Turkey. A costly pipeline project to carry gas between Crete, Greece and Italy is also being discussed. Mr Christodoulides’s priority will be to ensure that Cyprus’s long-awaited gas bonanza actually happens. </p>
<h3>The Grammys might get it right, at last</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Sunday American music’s great and good slap each others’ backs and dole out their annual awards. The sheer number of categories, at 91, speaks to the self-importance of the Recording Academy, which puts on the Grammys. That clubby self-regard has mired the awards show in controversy, prompting accusations of racism for snubs of black singers, and criticism for opaque voting procedures. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">This year, at least, the nominations reflect pop culture. Black artists are present in all the major categories and among the favourites; exciting young bands such as Idles, Turnstile and Wet Leg have nominations; and there is the chance for both Taylor Swift and Beyoncé to win the major awards that have, surprisingly, been denied them so far: song of the year for Ms Swift, and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/08/01/renaissance-is-a-clever-crowd-pleasing-pop-album">album of the year for Beyoncé</a>. Still, all awards ceremonies end in one certainty: that come the morning after, someone, somewhere will be up in arms about the injustice of it all.</p>
<h3>Brain-activity patterns cluster with ideology</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Everyone knows the frustration of arguing with a stubborn opponent. New research suggests that those on opposite sides of the political spectrum do not merely fail to see eye to eye; their brains <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/02/people-of-different-opinions-process-political-data-differently">behave differently</a> in ways that are stark enough to be detectable with fairly crude instruments. Two groups of researchers scanned the brains of left- and right-wingers as they were shown words and news clips. Using changes in blood flow as a proxy for neural activity, both found that the subjects’ brains responded in similar ways to neutral material, but diverged when presented with content about divisive topics like immigration. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Measuring blood flow using magnetic-resonance imaging, Daantje de Bruin and Oriel FeldmanHall, of Brown University in Rhode Island, recorded different patterns of activity in parts of the brain that handle emotions and cognition. Noa Katabi and Yaara Yeshurun, of Tel Aviv University, saw differences in the areas that deal with hearing, vision and movement. Big differences of opinion show up as big differences in brain activity.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: Max Martin, pop hitmaker</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Britney Spears brought the sex appeal, plaintive vocals and teen longing. Max Martin supplied the rest. In 1998 their track <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/prospero/2018/10/23/how-baby-one-more-time-changed-pop-music">“...Baby One More Time”</a> ruled the radio. Any allusions to domestic violence or sado-masochistic sex in the chorus—“Hit me baby one more time”—were supposedly unintentional. Mr Martin, the song’s Swedish writer and producer, says he understood “hit me” to mean “call me”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The earworm was the first of Mr Martin’s 25 <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/03/max-martin-knows-how-to-create-a-number-one-hit">number-one singles</a> on the Billboard Hot 100, a chart of America’s most popular songs. Only Paul McCartney and John Lennon rank higher as songwriters. His collaborators include pop heavyweights from Celine Dion to Taylor Swift. On Sunday, at the Grammy Awards, the 51-year-old has three separate nominations for album of the year: for his production work on Adele’s “30”, Lizzo’s “Special” and Coldplay’s “Music of the Spheres”.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Unlike the Beatles frontmen, Mr Martin has shunned the mic since his early days as a heavy-metal rocker in Sweden. Then he was known as Karl Martin Sandberg. But Denniz PoP, the producer who steered his turn towards songwriting, insisted that he rechristen himself. “‘Martin Sandberg’ wasn’t exactly a disco name, so you couldn’t really talk to him,” Mr PoP later recalled.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Martin is a proponent of a technique he calls “melodic math”, the principle that every element should serve the record and its melody. Words are chosen for their sound as much as their meaning. Take “...Baby One More Time”—the percussive Bs of “baby” make it a more common endearment in pop songs than, say, “darling”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2019, in a rare interview with the <em>Guardian</em>, he explained the importance of phonetics, and how “melodic math” came about as a result of not speaking English as a child. He would listen to Abba, Elton John and the Beatles without registering what the songs were about. “I felt something hearing this music, and it meant something to me,” he said. “If you can have a great lyric that also phonetically sounds amazing, then you’re golden. But it’s also kind of cool if you write a song and people are emotionally moved without understanding what’s being said.”</p>
<p class="customisedFont">All these years on, Mr Martin’s knack for meaningful nonsense shows no sign of diminishing.</p>
