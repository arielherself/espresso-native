<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Turkish</strong> officials said that they had issued at least 113 arrest warrants for architects, contractors and engineers connected with buildings that collapsed in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2023/02/09/the-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-syria-have-shaken-both-countries">devastating earthquakes</a> on February 6th. The government has been widely blamed for not enforcing construction standards. Meanwhile, unrest in the south of the country disrupted rescue efforts. The death toll in <strong>Turkey</strong> and neighbouring <strong>Syria</strong> has now passed 34,000.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Wang Wenbin, a <strong>Chinese</strong> foreign ministry spokesperson, claimed that <strong>American spy balloons</strong> have flown into Chinese airspace more than ten times in the past year. His comments came after America shot down yet another unidentified object on Sunday. It was the third such incident in North American airspace in as many days, and came after a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2023/02/07/the-lessons-from-the-chinese-spy-balloon">Chinese spy balloon</a> was downed on February 4th.</p>

His centre-left Social Democrats, who currently govern Germany’s capital in a coalition, took just 18.5% of the vote according to provisional results, compared with 27.5% for the conservative Christian Democratic party. The elections were a re-run of a nullified vote in 2021.</p>

Officials said they were retaliating for the firing of a rocket towards Israel. (It was intercepted.) Separately, Israel retroactively authorised nine Jewish settler outposts in the occupied West Bank, the first such move since Binyamin Netanyahu reclaimed the premiership in December last year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>India’s</strong> prime minister, Narendra Modi, said he wants to more than triple its annual <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2018/03/28/india-spends-a-fortune-on-defence-and-gets-poor-value-for-money">military</a> exports, from $1.5bn to $5bn, by 2024-25. Mr Modi, who also called on India’s private sector to invest more in arms manufacturing, made his comments at the Aero India show, a five-day event attended by firms including Lockheed Martin and Rolls Royce. India hopes to sign defence deals worth $9bn at the show.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">A spokesman for <strong>France’s</strong> government said that it was open to making concessions on its plan to raise the retirement age by two years.

<h3>Turkey’s corrupt construction in the spotlight</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">By Sunday, Turkish officials had issued at least 113 arrest warrants for architects, engineers and contractors they claim are responsible for buildings that collapsed during <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2023/02/09/the-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-syria-have-shaken-both-countries">catastrophic earthquakes</a> on February 6th. More warrants are expected in the next few days as the death toll, now higher than 34,000 in Turkey and in neighbouring Syria, spirals upward.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Many believe that the government is pointing the finger in the wrong direction. Although Turkey has strict building codes meant to protect against quakes, corruption and bad policymaking mean that they are poorly enforced. Analysts say that much of the blame lies with the governments of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/special-report/2023-01-21">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> and his predecessors and with municipal politicians.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The construction industry is riddled with weak links. The companies tasked with carrying out inspections to make sure standards are met are often paid by developers. Mr Erdogan’s government has also passed a series of amnesties, which allow illegal properties to be registered in exchange for a fine. The agency that carried out the most recent amnesty, in 2018, found that more than half of the country’s housing stock was not up to scratch. </p>
<h3>America, Japan and South Korea seek to co-operate</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Senior officials from America, Japan and South Korea meet in Washington, DC on Monday. They hope to boost security co-operation in the face of threats from North Korea and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america">China</a>. America has long wanted to work more closely with its two key east Asian allies, but tensions over Japan’s colonial history in South Korea have hampered efforts thus far. Dialogue among the three countries has picked up in the past year following the election of Yoon Suk-yeol, a conservative, as president of South Korea. Three-way military exercises, which had halted in 2017, resumed in 2022. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the past still presents a barrier to preparing for the future. In 2018 South Korea’s Supreme Court upheld rulings ordering Japanese firms to compensate South Koreans forced to work in factories during the second world war. Japan, which considers such claims settled through a treaty signed in 1965, was aghast. Efforts to negotiate a settlement have not yet borne fruit.</p>
<h3>A shakeup of Biden’s economic team</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser is expected to step down in the coming days. The departure of Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, is part of a wider turnover in White House staff at the two-year mark of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/president-joe-biden-polls">Mr Biden’s presidency</a>. Mr Deese played an important role in pushing the administration towards a bold economic strategy—an approach that brought legislative victories but also helped cause high inflation.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Deese advocated a giant stimulus package in early 2021 to counter the economic slowdown induced by the pandemic. He also helped to craft the Inflation Reduction Act, a big climate-investment bill that passed last year. His successor is yet to be named. Reports indicate that the leading candidates are Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the Treasury, and Lael Brainard, vice chair of the Federal Reserve. Whoever takes the job will have their hands full trying to implement Mr Deese’s designs.</p>
<h3>Giorgia Meloni’s first ballot box test</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Results are expected on Monday from regional elections in Lombardy, which includes Milan, and Lazio, which takes in Rome. The vote—in which almost a quarter of Italian voters can participate—is the first test of electoral support for the right-wing coalition led by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2023/01/26/after-a-steady-first-100-days-choppier-waters-await-giorgia-meloni">Giorgia Meloni</a>, the prime minister. Few observers doubt that her alliance will do well. The lack of suspense appears to have depressed turnout. When polls closed on Sunday evening the turnout was under 30% compared with more than 70% at the last comparable elections.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The right is predicted to hold Lombardy, which it has governed for almost 30 years. Polls also suggest that it will snatch Lazio from a divided left. The biggest unknown is whether a result that confirms increased support for Ms Meloni’s Brothers of Italy (FdI) party will exacerbate tensions with her coalition partners, the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party. The poll ratings of both have been reduced to single digits by FdI’s success.</p>
<h3>Abstract Expressionism gets a new narrative</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Abstract Expressionism has long been regarded as one of the most clearly defined artistic movements of the 20th century. But a new show in London challenges orthodoxy. “Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-70” opened at the Whitechapel Gallery on Thursday, and will run until May 7th. It offers an alternative to the conventional narrative of Abstract Expressionism as a uniquely American genre pioneered by men such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">“Action, Gesture, Paint” uses pieces loaned by Christian Levett, a British collector, and others to stress the contributions of women. Some, like Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler and Grace Hartigan, have already been highlighted in “Ninth Street Women”, a book by Mary Gabriel. The true novelty of this exhibition is to show that, in the post-war years, artists from Argentina to Japan produced work comparable to that of their American counterparts, celebrating freedom (or protesting against its absence) in bold, colourful, vigorous abstracts.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 GMT on Friday to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@economist.com"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="97c6e2feedd2e4e7e5f2e4e4f8d7f2f4f8f9f8fafee4e3b9f4f8fa">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. </p>
