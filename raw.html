Heavy fighting was reported in the region, and one official claimed it could be “liberated by September”. The city of Kherson was one of the first to fall to the Russians after they invaded Ukraine in February.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Russia’s</strong> foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, reassured his <strong>Egyptian</strong> counterpart in Cairo that commitments to export Russian <strong>grain</strong> would be honoured. He also refuted allegations that Russia is “exporting hunger”. His trip came after Russian missiles struck the port of Odessa, casting doubt on the viability of a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/22/after-agreeing-to-let-ukraine-export-grain-russia-rockets-its-port">deal to unblock grain exports</a> from Ukraine.

<h3>Russia tries to woo Africa</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, embarks on Sunday on a visit to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. The trip is in part a prelude to a Russia-Africa summit scheduled for next year. But Mr Lavrov has more immediate goals. Russia wants international support for its invasion of Ukraine, about which some African countries have <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/12/why-russia-wins-some-sympathy-in-africa-and-the-middle-east">expressed ambivalence</a>. It also wants to convince the continent’s leaders that Western sanctions, not Russia’s war of choice, are to blame for rising <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/briefing/2022/05/19/a-world-grain-shortage-puts-tens-of-millions-at-risk">food</a> and petrol prices. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ultimately Russia hopes to win African support in a wider ideological battle against the West. (<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/special-report/2022-05-28">China seeks the same.</a>) To foster goodwill, the Kremlin plays up the Soviet Union’s historical support for African decolonisation movements. Writing in several African newspapers on Friday Mr Lavrov said that, unlike the West, Russia “had not stained itself” with colonial crimes, and pledged to “continue to pursue a peace-loving foreign policy.” Ukrainians may disagree.</p>
<h3>The pope’s pilgrimage of penance</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">When Pope Francis arrives in Canada on Sunday for a five-day visit, his primary purpose will be not to preach but to do penance. He plans to apologise for the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/26/what-happened-at-residential-schools-for-indigenous-children-in-north-america">residential-schools</a> system, which from the early 19th century until 1996 separated indigenous children from their families and culture. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Canada’s government forced 150,000 children into the schools, 60% of which were run by the church. They were housed in inhuman conditions, and many were sexually abused. A horrifying number died. Last year hundreds of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-americas/2021/07/01/more-graves-are-found-at-canadian-schools-for-the-indigenous">unmarked graves</a> were discovered at sites of former schools. In 2015 a truth and reconciliation commission, established in response to lawsuits brought by indigenous Canadians, said the schools were part of a programme of “cultural genocide”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Francis has already said sorry. In a trip that will take him to Alberta, Quebec and the Arctic territory of Nunavut, he will atone at the scene of the crimes.</p>
<h3>China’s quest for the heavens</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>Tiangong</em>, China’s space station (the name means ​​“heavenly palace”), has been under construction since 2021, when its first module was launched. On Sunday a second module named <em>Wentian</em> (“quest for the heavens”) was blasted into orbit from a spaceport at Wenchang, off China’s southern coast. A third module is due to launch later this year. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Even when finished (probably next year) the 100-tonne <em>Tiangong</em> station will be a tiddler compared to the 440-tonne International Space Station. But China is not welcome aboard the ISS: a law in America, one of the ISS’s main funders, prohibits official contact with China’s space programme over national-security concerns.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">China’s space programme is nevertheless marching forward. It is only the third country, after America and the Soviet Union, to have mastered crewed spaceflight. Whether <em>Tiangong</em> will have any value beyond national pride is another question. Many scientists consider the ISS, with an estimated price tag of over $100bn, the most expensive white elephant ever built.</p>
<h3>Queen of the mountains</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Since 1989, when Jeannie Longo won the Tour de France Féminin for the third consecutive time, France’s premier long-distance cycling race has had no room for women. Organisers blamed a lack of money and interest. But times have changed. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">As the men’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/06/30/how-to-watch-the-tour-de-france-from-afar">Tour de France</a> finishes in Paris on Sunday, a new competition, the Tour de France Femmes, has its own <em>grand départ</em>. Television audiences in 170 countries can watch as the women’s peloton races across a 1,029km (639 miles) circuit over eight days. (The men’s race was 3,350km over 21 days.)</p>
<p class="customisedFont">As with most professional sports, women’s cycling suffers from less money and exposure than the male version. The female winner of the yellow jersey will take home 10% of what her male counterpart makes. Still, the race marks a gear shift. Broadcasting deals have locked networks into showing the 2023 tour, and Zwift, a training app, will sponsor the Tour de France Femmes for at least four years. Female cyclists have slogged to reach this point; it should be downhill from here.</p>
<h3>Weekend profile: the climatologists transforming how we discuss weather</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“People don’t have to die in their tens of thousands,” says Friederike Otto, with a touch of exasperation. In 2014 Dr Otto co-founded the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative, a collective of climate researchers and statisticians that has transformed the understanding of extreme weather events, such as the remarkable <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/the-increase-in-simultaneous-heatwaves">trio of heatwaves</a> that hit Europe, China and America this week. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The idea was born of frustration with the academic distinction between climate and weather. “Climate” denotes macro, long-term trends; “weather” is what’s going on outside your window. Most people are more interested in daily weather patterns than decadal or even longer-term patterns. In the 2010s a group of researchers decided that to make the world understand why climate change mattered, they needed to introduce it into conversations about the weather, including the forecasts people see on television. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Thus was the WWA conceived. The group works with the Red Cross Red Crescent’s Climate Centre, which gathers data on the number of people affected by any given climate event. If the number passes a certain threshold, Dr Otto and her collaborators, Sjoukje Philip and Sarah Kew of the Dutch meteorology institute, activate the WWA community. They canvass “everyone we know” to form an ad-hoc group of expert modellers. The exercise is, on the face of it, simple: to simulate two atmospheres, one with all the accumulated greenhouse-gas emissions of the last two centuries, and one that is unsullied. By comparing these two worlds, they can say whether a specific event is more or less likely to happen in a climate-changed atmosphere. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">This has led to headline-grabbing statements: that the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2021/08/23/climate-change-made-north-west-europes-lethal-flood-more-likely">northern European floods last year</a> were made up to nine times more likely by anthropogenic climate change, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/07/15/siberias-heatwave-would-not-have-happened-without-climate-change">Siberian heatwave of 2020</a> was many thousand times more likely, and the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/06/29/why-are-the-north-western-united-states-and-british-columbia-suffering-a-heatwave">Pacific Northwest heatwave</a> of 2021 would have been virtually impossible without historical emissions. Such statements, and the underlying methodology, are now part of the climate vernacular. They are also applied elsewhere, such as in legal disputes where people or communities <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/international/2022/04/23/lawsuits-aimed-at-greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-a-growing-trend">seek compensation for climate-change-induced damages</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Extreme heat is one of the most straightforward impacts of global warming, and virtually every contemporary heatwave was made <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/07/20/todays-heatwaves-are-a-warning-of-worse-to-come">worse or more likely by emissions</a>, or both. But Dr Otto worries that this engenders fatalism. “Yes it’s climate change…but we are also not powerless to do something about it,” she says. “That…is what’s missing in the conversation.”</p>
