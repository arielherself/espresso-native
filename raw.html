<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Joe Biden</strong> is expected to announce that America will dip further into its <strong>strategic oil reserves </strong>to help keep prices in check, following <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut">OPEC’s decision to reduce production</a>. On Tuesday the president approved the sale of the last tranche of 180m barrels he had authorised for release in March. He also told officials to prepare to tap more of the 400m barrels left in reserve—and to replenish stocks only after prices fall. With congressional <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/10/06/democrats-are-losing-on-the-economy-but-lead-on-other-issues">midterm elections</a> in three weeks, every bit of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem">inflationary pressure</a> is painful to the incumbent’s party.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Sergei Surovikin, the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/13/who-is-sergey-surovikin-russias-new-commander-in-ukraine">recently installed commander </a>of Russia’s forces in Ukraine, admitted that the situation in <strong>Kherson</strong> was “not easy” for his side. General Surovikin said that the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter">crucial</a> southern city was being hit by American-supplied <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/13/ukraines-new-rockets-are-wreaking-havoc-on-russias-army">HIMARS missiles</a>, and that residents would be evacuated. Ukraine’s recent counter-offensive has driven Russian troops in Kherson back by about 20-30km.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Britain’s</strong> annual <strong>inflation</strong> rate rose to 10.1% in September, matching the 40-year high <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/17/british-inflation-hits-double-digits">reached in July</a>. Inflation was driven by food prices, which increased by 14.6%. In response, Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor of the exchequer, said the government would “prioritise help for the most vulnerable”. The Bank of England has warned that inflation could exceed 13% this year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Elnaz Rekabi</strong>, the Iranian climber who competed without a hijab in South Korea, was greeted by cheering crowds upon returning to Tehran, <strong>Iran’s</strong> capital.

Under a new restructuring plan, Goldman will split up its consumer operation, bundling its savings and wealth products into the asset-management arm, and sticking the lending ones into a new “platforms” business, alongside wholesale and business banking.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">James Cleverly, <strong>Britain’s</strong> foreign secretary, said on Wednesday that the government was considering further action over the “unacceptable” beating of a protester outside the <strong>Chinese consulate in Manchester</strong>. On Sunday British police intervened after a small group of men came out of the consulate and assaulted a man demonstrating against Xi Jinping, China’s president. China’s foreign ministry, meanwhile, complained about illegal entry into their consulate. </p>

<h3>European inflation has not yet peaked</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">In September, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/31/europe-is-heading-for-recession-how-bad-will-it-be">inflation</a> in the euro zone came in at 9.9%, almost—but not quite—reaching double digits for the first time. Unfortunately for policymakers, inflation is spreading across the economy. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">New figures released on Wednesday from Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, provide the full picture of the rising inflationary pressures. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/29/europes-next-energy-crunch">Energy prices</a> rose by a staggering 40% in September, compared with a year earlier. Food prices rose 12%. These prices are volatile and will (with any luck) fall again. But goods and services prices also increased, by 5.5% and 4.3% respectively, and will be harder to bring down. In fact, goods inflation seems to be accelerating: prices rose at an annualised rate of 38% between August and September.At a meeting next week the European Central Bank will have to take stock of such depressing numbers, and act accordingly. Expect another chunky rise in interest rates.</p>
<h3>Could Oregon elect a Republican governor?</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Oregon is one of America’s most politically progressive states. In 2021 it <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2021/02/13/oregon-decriminalises-drugs-for-personal-use">decriminalised</a> personal drug use. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2021/06/12/portland-was-once-a-byword-for-tattooed-vegan-microbrewers">Portland</a>, Oregon’s biggest city, regularly holds <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/1843/2020/08/06/tear-gas-batonsthen-nothing-the-night-the-feds-left-portland">protests for racial justice</a>. The state has picked a Democratic president in every election since 1988 and has had a Democratic governor since 1987. Yet this year the governor’s race is surprisingly close.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Polls suggest that Christine Drazan, the Republican candidate (pictured), has an edge over Tina Kotek, her Democratic opponent. Betsy Johnson, an independent, is trailing but splitting the vote. A hustings on Wednesday night will focus on troubles in Portland.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The city faces an increase in violent crime and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2021/08/02/the-pandemic-has-made-homelessness-more-visible-in-many-american-cities">homelessness</a>. The homeless population of the county which contains Portland grew by 30% between 2019 and 2022 as rents rocketed during the pandemic. Homelessness dominates west-coast politics; voters in Oregon say it is the most important problem facing their state. If liberals cannot solve such issues, their rivals may be invited to try.</p>
<h3>Dented profits for aluminium producers</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">From cars to Coke cans, aluminium is one of the most widely used metals. But ubiquity and profitability do not always go hand-in-hand. After seven bumper quarters Alcoa, America’s largest producer, is on Wednesday expected to report a big drop in quarterly operating profits. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Aluminium producers’ profits are shaped by supply and demand. From mid-2020 prices enjoyed a stunning rise, as energy-supply issues led to a fall in production in <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2021/10/23/zhongwang-a-chinese-aluminium-giant-resists-american-pressure">China</a>, the world’s biggest producer, and later in Europe. At the same time demand rose as locked-down consumers drank more at home, boosting demand for aluminium cans, and governments planned recovery infrastructure projects. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Prices peaked in March, at the highest since 1990, but have since collapsed. Chinese production is increasing just as a slowing global economy squeezes demand. America may yet increase tariffs on imports of aluminium from Russia, the third-largest producer, in step with its sanctions over the war in Ukraine. If that happens, expect another spike in prices, and profits for Alcoa.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong’s policy address</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For such a stunning city, Hong Kong is deeply unattractive. Over the past two-and-a-half years it has maintained some of the world’s most restrictive covid measures while simultaneously becoming <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state">a police state</a>. No surprise then that Hong Kongers and foreign executives have fled. A third of fund-management companies, for example, have moved staff out of the once-bustling financial hub. In all, nearly 3% of the population has left during the past two years. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Such was the backdrop on Wednesday to John Lee’s first annual policy address as Hong Kong’s leader. Mr Lee responded by promising an “all-out-war for talent”, incentivising foreign executives to relocate to the city and launching schemes to persuade deserters to return. But despite having already relaxed some of the more onerous covid rules, he refrained from announcing the hoped-for full re-opening. As for Hong Kong’s autocratic lurch? Neither Mr Lee nor his boss, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/theprincepod">Xi Jinping</a>, China’s president, could be more pleased with how that has gone.</p>
<h3>Crypto’s white knight</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The vicious drop in crypto asset prices that began late last year has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/05/18/the-cryptocurrency-sell-off-has-exposed-those-swimming-naked">ruined firms</a> across the industry. Crypto exchanges, lenders, hedge funds and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/12/16/what-are-stablecoins-such-as-tether">stablecoins</a> saw billions in value wiped out in the spring. Some went bankrupt.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Yet in every crisis there is also an opportunity. <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/05/cryptos-last-man-standing">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, a 30-year-old billionaire widely known as SBF, and FTX, his crypto exchange, have survived the industry’s rout. FTX has even injected capital into struggling peers. In June FTX opened a line of credit with BlockFi, which offers crypto-banking, and in July signed an option to buy it. In September FTX bid $1.4bn to acquire Voyager, a collapsed crypto brokerage (to which SBF’s trading firm, Alameda, had previously lent money).</p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Wednesday a bankruptcy court will consider whether to let the deal proceed. Regulators in Texas are investigating both FTX and Voyager for securities violations and have asked the court to halt the deal. SBF’s winning streak looks in danger.</p>
