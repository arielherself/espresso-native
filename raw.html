<p class="customisedFont">At the <strong>UN General Assembly</strong> 143 countries approved a resolution condemning <strong>Russia’s</strong> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/30/what-is-annexation">illegal annexation</a> of four Ukrainian regions. Thirty-five countries abstained, including China and India, while five countries voted against the motion. Meanwhile Britain, Canada, France and the Netherlands promised to send more <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/12/who-is-doing-most-to-help-ukraine-against-russia">military aid</a> to <strong>Ukraine</strong>, including <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/11/how-the-west-is-helping-ukraine-beat-russias-missiles">advanced air-defence systems</a>, following a NATO meeting in Brussels. America had already made a similar pledge. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, explicitly stated that his country would not respond with nuclear weapons if Russia deployed them in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Inflation</strong> in <strong>America</strong> rose by more than expected last month with the consumer price index up 0.4% in September compared with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem">August</a>.

<h3>America remains in the grip of inflation</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The latest data on headline inflation in America, released on Thursday, was higher than expected with prices rising 0.4% in September compared with <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem">August</a>. And beneath the surface, inflationary momentum is even stronger. Core inflation (stripping out volatile food and energy costs) rose by 0.6% month-on-month.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">With this latest evidence that inflation is still running high, investors are all but certain that the Federal Reserve will deliver yet another <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/21/as-america-raises-rates-the-rest-of-the-world-bears-the-pain">jumbo rate increase</a> next month and perhaps one more before the end of the year. The aggressive pace of tightening is <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/markets-are-reeling-from-higher-rates-the-world-economy-is-next">weighing heavily</a> on global stock and bond markets, leading some critics to call for the Fed to relent. But until inflation itself relents, it will stay on the warpath.</p>
<h3>Congress’s final January 6th hearing</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The congressional committee investigating the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2021/01/06/trumps-supporters-storm-the-capitol-to-block-the-transfer-of-power">attack on the Capitol</a> on January 6th 2021 will hold what is expected to be its final hearing on Thursday. This instalment will focus on summarising the case against Donald Trump for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/06/29/donald-trumps-shameful-role-in-the-storming-of-the-capitol">failing to stop</a> those of his supporters who sacked the building in a bid to overturn his election loss. The committee plans to issue a final report before the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate">next Congress</a> sits in January. If Republicans take control after November’s elections, they are likely to suspend the committee’s unfinished work and to counter-attack by blaming Democrats for intelligence and security failures on the day. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Exactly how much criminality the current investigators have unearthed is unclear. The <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/07/27/the-justice-department-is-moving-against-donald-trump">Department of Justice</a>, which makes independent decisions on criminal charges, has seized phones of some of the central actors identified by the committee. But the scope of its inquiry remains unclear. Mr Trump, who is no stranger to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in">legal jeopardy</a>, appears largely unfazed.</p>
<h3>The Bank of England’s tough love</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The disastrous consequences of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/10/11/liz-truss-has-made-britain-a-riskier-bet-for-bond-investors">British government’s</a> <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically">mini-budget</a> of September 23rd continue to reverberate through febrile markets. Days after the budget the Bank of England was forced to intervene with an emergency bond-buying scheme aimed at helping troubled pension funds and stopping a fire-sale of <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/10/12/britains-government-is-yet-to-deal-with-a-mess-of-its-own-making" data-tegid="itqqp9bcetje19hglu3f55odum126kb2">gilts</a>. On Wednesday the bank reiterated its commitment to ending the scheme by Friday—but only after mixed-messaging had sent the pound whipsawing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But what happens after Friday? The worry is that after the withdrawal of the bank as the buyer of last resort, chaotic selling will resume. The bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, told the pension funds on Tuesday that they had to “sort out” their financial resilience before the deadline. Few in the market, however, seriously expect the bank to sit on its hands if widespread disorder returns. Underlying all the jitters is a basic scepticism about the government’s ability to fund its planned tax cuts, which Liz Truss, the prime minister, is under increasing pressure to reverse. Until that is dealt with, expect more jitters.</p>
<h3>A controversial new speaker for Italy’s Senate</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On Thursday Italy’s new parliament meets for the first time since last month’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/25/italy-chooses-a-party-with-a-neo-fascist-legacy">general election</a>. A coalition of right-wing parties emerged with solid majorities in both houses. Together the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-brothers-of-italy-look-set-to-win-the-next-election">Brothers of Italy</a> (FdI), the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party won 74 seats more than the opposition in the 400-member Chamber of Deputies, and 30 more in the 200-seat Senate. Giorgia Meloni of the hard-right FdI is almost certain to become prime minister before the end of the month. But the lawmakers’ first task will be to choose speakers for both houses.<br/><br/> Deciding who will preside over the Senate is particularly sensitive: the speaker would succeed Italy’s 81 year-old president, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/01/30/the-re-election-of-sergio-mattarella-as-president-saves-italys-governing-coalition">Sergio Mattarella</a>, were he to die or be incapacitated. A leading FdI lawmaker said the right had agreed on Ignazio La Russa, a gravelly-voiced ex-defence minister who has a collection of fascist memorabilia at home and joked during the pandemic that Italians should use the fascist salute to avoid shaking hands.</p>
<h3>A film festival about immigration</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">For nine years the Immigration Film Fest has shared the stories of immigrants—often produced by immigrants themselves. This year’s event, which begins on Thursday with screenings in Washington and online, will showcase nearly 40.<br/> “Operation: Allies Welcome” follows Afghans fleeing the Taliban as they settle in northern Virginia. “Stop Time” chronicles how a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/erasmus/2018/10/17/when-houses-of-prayer-become-places-of-shelter">sanctuary church</a> housed Lucio Perez, an undocumented migrant, for three years in defiance of a deportation order. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The theme of the festival, “home”, is the focus of “My DACA Life”, a documentary about Maribel, a young undocumented migrant who arrived in America as a child. She was granted leave to stay under Barack Obama’s DREAM Act. After she made her first trip back to Mexico, that right was overturned under <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2017/09/09/donald-trump-ditches-daca">Donald Trump</a>. As American policymakers face increasing numbers of arrivals and continue to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall">struggle</a> to develop fair and politically acceptable immigration policies, stories such as Maribel’s need to be told.</p>
