<p class="customisedFont">France said Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, had told his French counterpart that UN inspectors could access the <strong>Zaporizhia nuclear plant</strong> in south-eastern Ukraine. An international mission would require a temporary ceasefire around the Russian-controlled power station, which has been the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant">target of shelling</a> for weeks, said French officials. Meanwhile António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, affirmed that Zaporizhia’s electricity belongs to Ukraine, amid fears that power could be diverted to the Russian grid. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of planning further attacks at the plant.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Gazprom, <strong>Russia’s </strong>state-owned energy firm, said it would halt <strong>natural-gas</strong> deliveries to Europe via its main pipeline for three days at the end of August. It said the reason was unscheduled maintenance to <strong>Nord Stream 1</strong>, which links <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter">Russia to Germany</a> via the Baltic sea and is already running at just a fifth of its capacity.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Xiao Jianhua</strong>, a Chinese-Canadian billionaire financier, was sentenced to 13 years in prison by a <strong>Chinese court</strong>, on charges of bribing officials to evade financial scrutiny as well as illegally obtaining public deposits and breaching trust. His company, believed to have links to high-ranking politicians, was fined a record sum of 55bn yuan ($8.1bn). Mr Xiao, seized from a Hong Kong hotel room in 2017, was <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/07/what-a-tycoons-trial-says-about-the-rot-in-chinas-financial-system">tried behind closed doors</a> in July.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Finland’s</strong> prime minister took a drug test to quell a brouhaha over video footage of her partying and dancing with friends. Sanna Marin, aged 36, said the results would put to rest the “grave public accusations” that she had used drugs, though she called demands for her to take a test “unjust”. The results will be available in a week.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Britons’ <strong>consumer confidence</strong> plunged to historic lows on Friday, according to research by data provider GfK. Respondents were gloomy about all five component parts of the consumer confidence index, reflecting “a sense of exasperation about the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/08/11/britains-economy-is-taking-a-drubbing">UK&#x27;s economy</a>”, according to a GfK director. Separately, Britain reported a fall of 1.2% in retail sales in the three months to July.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Olaf Scholz</strong>, Germany’s chancellor, denied allegations of impropriety in his management of a multibillion-euro<strong> tax fraud case</strong> while acting as mayor of Hamburg in 2017. Mr Scholz stands accused of deliberately failing to collect €47m ($47m) in tax payments from Warburg, a local bank. The investigation comes at a difficult time for Mr Scholz as he grapples with Germany’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/21/germans-have-been-living-in-a-dream">energy crunch</a> alongside his own dipping popularity.</p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Xiaomi</strong>, a Chinese tech company, reported a 20% <strong>revenue drop</strong> to 70.2bn yuan ($10.3bn) for the second quarter, a worse performance than analysts predicted. Net income dropped by 83% to 1.39bn. The company cited the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/china/2022/08/18/chinas-economy-is-beset-by-problems">pandemic</a>, increased fuel prices, input costs and inflation as reasons for the downturn. Formerly China’s biggest smartphone brand, Xiaomi has struggled against domestic competition.</p>

<h3>Mike Pence’s barnstorming</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Iowa state fair is a rite of passage for presidential hopefuls. In campaign years candidates and the hacks covering them flock to the event. Once there they consume calorific inventions served on sticks and glad-handle voters ahead of Iowa’s nominating contest, which comes first in the presidential-election cycle. The next presidential election is not until 2024, yet on Friday Mike Pence, Donald Trump’s former vice-president, will make an appearance in Des Moines. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">He comes to Iowa’s capital straight from New Hampshire, another early-voting state, where he told attendees at an event that Republicans should stop attacking the FBI over its <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/united-states/2022/08/17/merrick-garland-is-not-naive-about-political-violence">raid of his former boss’s estate</a>. He also said he would consider testifying before congressional investigators probing the Capitol riot on January 6th 2021. Mr Pence appears to have completely fallen out with Mr Trump; his itinerary suggests he may well covet the presidency for himself. Does presidential-campaign season now start before the mid-terms have even finished?</p>
<h3>Russian-Israeli relations in the dock</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Lawyers for the Jewish Agency for Israel, an international organisation which acts on behalf of the Israeli government, are fighting to continue its presence in Russia. At their own request, their appearance before a Russian court on Friday was postponed at the last minute. The Kremlin accuses the JA, which helps Jews move to Israel, of illegally collecting the personal information of Russian citizens.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The accusation seems to be a warning to Israel to<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/28/israels-russian-conundrum"> remain neutral</a> on the war in Ukraine—a position partly owing to its own large Russian-speaking population. But the country’s prime minister, Yair Lapid, condemned Russia’s invasion before he took office in July. The scale of emigration since the start of the war suggests that many Jews agree with Mr Lapid. The JA reckons that around 20,500 Russian Jews have moved to Israel since March, over 12% of Russia’s estimated Jewish population. The Kremlin may succeed in shutting down the JA. But that will not convince other Jews to stay in Russia.</p>
<h3>South Korea and Japan court disaster</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Yoon Suk-yeol has historic ambitions for his country’s relationship with neighbouring Japan. On August 17th South Korea’s president said that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/09/03/why-japan-and-south-korea-bicker">the two countries’ enmity</a>, stemming from Japan’s colonial rule over Korea from 1910 to 1945, could be swept aside “amicably and promptly”. His enthusiasm is understandable—a bit of bonhomie could make both countries <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/07/07/south-korea-and-japan-have-a-rare-chance-to-make-friends">richer and more secure</a>, especially in the face of rising tensions in the region.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">His optimism makes less sense. The path to rapprochement is long and treacherous, and the journey could end almost before it has begun. In 2018 South Korea’s courts approved the seizure of assets from certain Japanese companies, on the basis that Koreans had been forced to toil on their behalf during the second world war. The liquidated assets would be given to the victims. The companies refused to pay, but the court’s final <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2018/12/22/japanese-firms-resist-compensating-forced-wartime-labourers-from-korea">decision</a> may come as early as Friday. Forcing the firms to pay up will enrage Japan, and will probably put paid to Mr Yoon’s aspirations.</p>
<h3>Stasi assassins, synths and a suitcase</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">“Kleo” is intense—and brutal—from the off. Set after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the series, released on Netflix on Friday, follows Kleo Straub, a fictional former Stasi assassin. She embarks on a mission to settle scores, deploying disguises, dark humour and outlandish fashion choices that will remind many viewers of the BBC’s “Killing Eve”. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Feminist revenge dramas are in vogue. They can seem repetitive, but “Kleo” attempts to differentiate itself with a historical twist. The show explores the contrasts between east and west Germany in the post-Soviet era and is infused with real events and people, such as Erich Mielke, the Stasi chief. There is also a suitcase full of clues, for the spy-drama addicts. It is a novel way into a subgenre that every streaming company wants a slice of. And Netflix could do with a boost: it lost nearly 1m subscribers in the three months to July, the biggest drop in the company’s history.</p>
<h3>A deadly toll for aid workers</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Wherever there is conflict, there are people who run to help. Being an aid worker in unstable or violent regions always carries risks, but 2021 was the deadliest year in nearly a decade for humanitarian staff. According to data from Humanitarian Outcomes, a consultancy in London, 141 were killed. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">On Friday the UN will mark World Humanitarian Day with a campaign to raise awareness about the rising toll on aid workers. Despite there being fewer violent incidents in 2021 compared with the previous two years, the 268 reported attacks, mostly shootings and airstrikes, resulted in more deaths, and 117 people were kidnapped.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">South Sudan remains the most dangerous place in the world for aid workers. Afghanistan comes second, despite a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/15/violence-in-afghanistan-has-dropped-under-the-taliban">dip in overall violence</a> since the Taliban returned to power. With war now raging in Ukraine, this year could be even worse for humanitarians. </p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme.
