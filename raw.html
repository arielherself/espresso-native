<h3>2022 in review: The worldwide cost-of-living crisis</h3>
<p class="customisedFont"><em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, finance and economics</em></p>
<p class="customisedFont">In 2021, following government splurges in response to the pandemic, many economists believed temporary inflation was inescapable. Few expected what unfolded. In 2022 inflation rates in many countries soared into double digits. Global inflation for 2022 is expected to be 8.8%, according to the IMF. In poor countries, the UN estimates that rising prices may have pushed 71m people into poverty. Those in rich countries, such as <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/09/08/the-cost-of-living-crisis-in-britain-is-not-just-about-energy">Britain</a>, also felt the squeeze.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Big central banks, led by America’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/04/23/why-the-federal-reserve-has-made-a-historic-mistake-on-inflation">Federal Reserve</a>, were forced into action, implementing the fastest and biggest interest-rate increases since the 1980s. In recent weeks inflation has decelerated, primarily because energy prices have fallen and supply chains are operating more smoothly. That will reduce the pace of central banks’ interest-rate rises, but they will <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/07/inflation-is-falling-but-not-enough">still have to be vigilant</a>. Tight labour markets, loose fiscal policy and turbulent energy markets will continue to push prices higher.</p>
<h3>2022 in review: A new normal for investors</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">After the global financial crisis of 2007-09, as interest rates fell and stayed low, asset prices surged and a “bull market in everything” took hold. In 2022 rising interest rates and runaway inflation put a painful end to that. At its lowest point of the year, the S&amp;P 500 index of leading American shares had lost more than $10trn in market value. Government bonds, usually a shelter from stocks, have also been hit. Meanwhile, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/10/20/a-global-house-price-slump-is-coming">house prices are falling</a> everywhere from Vancouver to Sydney.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This year’s capital losses, however, have a silver lining. If the downside of higher asset prices was lower expected returns then, by symmetry, future real returns have now gone up. Investors need to change their <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/12/08/investing-in-an-era-of-higher-interest-rates-and-scarcer-capital">approach to markets</a>. The new regime of higher interest rates and scarcer capital may seem like a shock, but for much of history these were the normal conditions for investors. It was the era of cheap money that was weird.</p>
<h3>2022 in review: The unlikely economic winners</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It has been a rough year for almost everyone. Inflation has been rampant; markets have been in turmoil. Yet this poor aggregate performance hides wide differences: some countries have done pretty well. <em>The Economist</em> has <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/18/2022s-unlikely-economic-winners">ranked 34 mostly rich countries</a> on five economic and financial indicators, including GDP, inflation and stockmarket performance. The ranking finds especially bright spots in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Top of our list is Greece. Other countries that plumbed the economic depths in the early 2010s, such as Portugal and Spain, also score highly, thanks to the lifting of covid lockdowns and a recovery in tourism. Two Baltic countries, Estonia and Latvia, which won plaudits in the 2010s for speedy reforms but rely on Russia for energy, come bottom.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Still, the gap between 2022’s winners and losers may not persist in 2023. Before long, growth in southern Europe, weighed down by rapidly ageing populations and high debts, will surely fall back to less stellar levels.</p>
<h3>2022 in review: The collapse of crypto</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">It has been a terrible year for cryptocurrencies. In May Terra-Luna, a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/12/16/what-are-stablecoins-such-as-tether">decentralised stablecoin system</a>, worth around $40bn at its peak, collapsed, taking some $200bn off the market capitalisation of crypto with it. That led to the demise of other lending platforms and a hedge fund, wiping out another $200bn. Then came the biggest shock. In November FTX, the third-largest crypto trading platform at the time, filed for <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried">bankruptcy</a>. The exchange is accused of lending customer funds to Alameda, a trading firm also owned by the once-feted <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/05/cryptos-last-man-standing">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> which allegedly then used the funds to make risky bets. The revelations sparked contagion and other big crypto firms collapsed.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">As with previous crypto winters, there were existential questions about the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto">utility of crypto</a>. Many speculated that FTX’s implosion could kill the entire market. That may be far-fetched. As bad a year as they have had, cryptocurrencies&#x27; market capitalisation is currently around $900bn, still 50% more than the value five years ago.</p>
