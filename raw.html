Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called the Russian army “weaklings who fight civilians”. Meanwhile Mr Zelensky emerged unscathed from a car accident in Kyiv, the capital. He was returning from the city of Izyum, which was liberated during Ukraine’s <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run" data-tegid="snudeohht55arf6598k3ea2j6hetveh5">recent counter-offensive</a>.</p>

<h3>France faces an energy squeeze</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Like the rest of Europe, France has been battered by the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/europes-energy-market-was-not-built-for-this-crisis">inflationary consequences</a> of Russia’s war on Ukraine. But the French have been largely protected from the worst of the blow. August’s annual inflation figure of 5.9%, released on Thursday, confirms that prices have been rising more modestly in France than elsewhere in Europe. This is mainly because President Emmanuel Macron’s government has been spending heavily to insulate consumers from soaring energy prices. On Wednesday it said it would further limit gas and electricity price rises for households to 15% next year.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">France has also been partly shielded from the tumult in global gas prices by its unusual dependence on nuclear power, which provides 42% of its energy supply. Still, this nuclear preponderance currently presents its own challenge. France is usually a net exporter of electricity. But over half of its 56 <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/frances-nuclear-plants-are-going-down-for-repairs">nuclear reactors</a> are down for maintenance. That has left the country having to import electricity at high wholesale prices.</p>
<h3>Xi and Putin talk shop in Samarkand</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Western leaders are not invited to the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/what-is-the-shanghai-co-operation-organisation">Shanghai Co-operation Organisation’s</a> summit, which takes place in Uzbekistan on Thursday and Friday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the event to discuss Ukraine and Taiwan. Some other attendees, including Iran’s president, Ebrahim Rasi, share the pair’s anti-American worldview.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But the West has nothing to fear from the SCO. Founded by China, Russia and four Central Asian states in 2001, it is largely a talking-shop that focuses on regional economic and security issues. It is known for its ineffectiveness, made worse by a string of enlargements. India and Pakistan joined in 2017, importing to the SCO their fraught historical relationship. Iran’s accession, agreed in 2021, imperils consensus, too. Mr Xi and Mr Putin may wax lyrical about their visions of a “multipolar” world, but the SCO itself will focus on more grounded topics, such as the construction of two <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/09/06/two-new-railway-lines-could-transform-central-asia">Chinese-backed railway lines</a> in Central Asia.</p>
<h3>A rail strike narrowly avoided in America</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Much of American industry runs on rails. Nearly a third of domestic cargo shipments are moved by train. A strike can <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/01/29/why-supply-chain-problems-arent-going-away">wreak havoc with supply chains</a>. So it came as a relief when on Thursday morning America’s 115,000 railway workers called off a planned strike at the very last minute. For two years their unions and railway bosses had failed to agree on a pay deal. But following all-night talks, brokered by the Biden administration, freight rail companies and unions agreed to a pay rise of 24% over five years.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Union members will still need to ratify the deal. But the big train firms have worries beyond this dispute. Staff shortages, exacerbated by years of lay-offs, have slowed service. Regulators are irked. The head of the Surface Transportation Board has scolded carriers for their “attitude of indifference” and promised more oversight. But Mr Biden believes the deal could go some way in fixing that problem, too, by making it easier to retain and recruit workers.</p>
<h3>Britain’s queen lies in state</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">One week after the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown">death of Queen Elizabeth II</a>, Thursday marks the first full day of her lying in state in London. Up to 750,000 people are expected to queue for miles to glimpse her coffin in Westminster Hall.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Lying in state is observed by many countries. In Britain it is the preserve of sovereigns, their consorts and select prime ministers. The modern tradition of lying in state at Westminster Hall started in 1898 with prime minister William Gladstone. Queen Victoria declined the honour. Her son, Edward VII, became the first monarch to do so, in 1910. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Elizabeth’s coffin is guarded by a vigil of soldiers. Her four children will take a turn, too. That ritual is the “Vigil of the Princes”. Yet in Scotland this week Anne, the Princess Royal, became the first woman ever to take part. In death as in life, the queen coaxes the royal family a little further into the modern world.</p>
<h3>Ukraine’s pirouettes of patriotism</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">An old conservatory in The Hague has become a haven for more than 50 <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/culture/2022/06/30/a-ukrainian-ballerina-goes-to-war">ballet dancers</a> forced by war to flee Ukraine. Spurred into action by Igone de Jongh, a Dutch former prima ballerina who became their artistic director, and supported by English and Dutch ballet companies, the dancers formed the United Ukrainian Ballet.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">This week the group performs “Giselle”, a romantic tragedy, at the Coliseum in London. For the dancers in exile, every <em>penché</em> and pirouette is felt to be an act of patriotism—and a moment of respite from thoughts of war. Ballet is a “way to express my emotions…not to hold everything inside”, says Oleksii Kniazkov, a dancer from Kharkiv. Alexei Ratmansky, a luminary choreographer who grew up in Kyiv, is working with the company. The themes of hope and forgiveness in “Giselle” resonate, he explains. “It’s telling us that love is stronger than death.” That is worth dancing for.</p>
<h3>Daily quiz</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Our baristas will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 BST on <strong>Friday</strong> to <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@economist.com"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fcad899586b98f8c8e998f8f93bc999f93929391958f88d29f9391">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown one winner per continent on Saturday.</p>
