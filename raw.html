<p class="customisedFont">Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, said dozens of cities have been liberated in regions which <strong>Russia</strong> illegally annexed last week after <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/ignore-putins-fake-referendums-and-keep-helping-ukraine">a series of sham referendums</a>. Mr Zelensky said the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame">Ukrainian army is now advancing</a> in a “rapid and powerful manner” in the south of the country. On Tuesday maps published by Russia’s defence ministry showed that Russian forces have retreated significantly amid Ukraine’s counter-offensives.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Shares of <strong>Twitter </strong>surged by more than 20% on the news that <strong>Elon Musk </strong>will go ahead with his takeover of the social-media company. Mr Musk has offered to pay the price he initially agreed, of $54.20 a share. For months he had tried to renege on his purchase agreement, resulting in a <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/15/twitters-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-44bn-offer">legal dispute</a> with Twitter that was expected to go to trial later this month. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>America</strong> and <strong>South Korea</strong> carried out military drills after <strong>North Korea</strong> launched a ballistic missile over Japan. The exercises included firing several American-made missiles into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan (one South Korean-made missile was launched but crashed immediately). North Korea has now launched five missiles in a week, and has been <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2022/04/07/north-korea-is-testing-icbms-again-nuclear-weapons-may-be-next">ratcheting up its weapons testing overall</a>. </p>
<p class="customisedFont"><strong>Donald Trump</strong> asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the Justice Department’s investigation into his possible mishandling of<strong> classified documents</strong>. America’s former president is seeking the reversal of a lower-court ruling that gave federal authorities immediate access to classified material seized from his Florida estate. He would like an independent arbiter to review them, since he claims they are covered by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/31/what-is-executive-privilege">executive privilege</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The <strong>stockmarket</strong> in <strong>Hong Kong</strong> climbed significantly on Wednesday, having been closed for a public holiday the day before. The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose by more than 5%, reflecting a <strong>global rally</strong> based on hopes that central banks might soon become less aggressive about <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/29/global-rate-rises-are-happening-on-an-unprecedented-scale">raising interest rates</a>. Despite this, New Zealand bumped rates to a seven-year high on Wednesday. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">Up to 80% of <strong>Bangladesh’s</strong> territory was left without power after the national grid faltered under excess demand. The country has suffered regular power cuts this year because of shortages in natural gas, which accounts for some 75% of the country’s generation. Power demand in Bangladesh has been driven by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/asia/2019/09/12/bangladesh-tries-to-muffle-the-siren-song-of-the-capital">fast-expanding</a> residential developments.</p>

<h3>The Kremlin’s botched land grab</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Russian parliament’s approval of the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts">illegal annexation</a> of four Ukrainian regions, finalised by its upper house on Tuesday, rubber-stamped President Vladimir Putin’s proclamation that Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhia are part of Russia following <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/27/vladimir-putin-stages-four-fake-referendums-in-occupied-ukraine">fake referendums</a>. The legislation now returns to Mr Putin for his signing into law.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">But Mr Putin’s alternative reality adds to his <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame">mounting problems</a>. The annexations mean that Russia does not control territories it claims. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains on multiple fronts, taking Lyman, a logistics hub in Donetsk, while pushing back into Kherson province in the south. The setbacks are sowing divisions among Russia’s elite. Nezavisimaya, an influential Russian newspaper, called the loss of Lyman “a political problem”, citing Chechnya’s leader, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/16/who-is-ramzan-kadyrov-the-brutal-chechen-leader-claiming-to-be-in-ukraine">Ramzan Kadyrov</a>, who blamed senior military figures for making poor tactical decisions. The rebukes do not yet target Mr Putin, but further losses will only heighten tensions among his lieutenants.</p>
<h3>America’s worker shortage eases slightly</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey used to be a sideshow in American economic data. Over the past year it has become an essential indicator, providing a glimpse into the <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/business/2022/09/05/why-businesses-are-furiously-hiring-even-as-a-downturn-looms">ultra-tight job market</a>. On Tuesday it showed that 10m jobs were open as of August, down by a million from July. That is exactly what the Federal Reserve wants to see. Although America still has nearly twice as many available jobs as it does unemployed people, the decline in openings suggests the mismatch is easing. That could alleviate the upward pressure on wages that has fed through into <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/films/2022/08/04/inflation-and-the-global-economy">inflation</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">The next question is whether the unemployment rate—next due on Friday—has increased or not. If unemployment holds steady even as job openings decline, that will lend support to the view of optimistic economics that, by skimming off excess demand, America can enjoy a slowdown in inflation without suffering a steep rise in unemployment. It is a glimmer of hope.</p>
<h3>The knotty making of Italy’s government</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">The leadership of the Northern League, an Italian populist party, met on Tuesday to choose which of its politicians it wants to sit at Giorgia Meloni’s cabinet table. Ms Meloni, the leader of the hard-right Brothers of Italy and <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/09/25/italy-chooses-a-party-with-a-neo-fascist-legacy">prime minister-in-waiting</a>, is struggling to form a team that reassures Italy’s allies and satisfies her partners in the hard right coalition that <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/italys-next-government-may-be-more-nationalist-than-europe-likes">won September’s election</a>.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Ms Meloni will struggle to place Matteo Salvini, the League’s pugnacious secretary. He wants to resume the campaign against irregular immigration he waged as interior minister in 2018-19. One option is putting him back in charge of law and order. But Mr Salvini is on trial for blocking migrants from entering port while in office. There is talk of a deputy premiership. But his past support for Russia makes Italy’s allies in NATO suspicious. He could also be given responsibility for agriculture. But would Mr Salvini, strongly critical of the EU, accept a portfolio in which most important decisions are taken in Brussels?</p>
<h3>A police shooting in London</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">On September 5th a Metropolitan Police officer shot dead Chris Kaba, an unarmed black man, after chasing the car he was driving through south London. The killing drew hundreds of protesters to Scotland Yard, London’s police headquarters, to decry racism. Little is known about what caused the officer, who has been suspended, to shoot. An automated system linked the vehicle’s number plates to an earlier firearms offence. But more will become clear after an inquest into Mr Kaba’s death opens on Tuesday. The killing is also being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, a watchdog.</p>
<p class="customisedFont">Mr Kaba’s death puts Britain’s largest police force under fresh scrutiny. Buffeted by <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/londons-metropolitan-police-service-is-failing-on-three-fronts/21807604">scandals</a>, the Met was recently <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/britain/2022/06/30/the-metropolitan-police-is-put-into-special-measures">put under examination</a> by another watchdog and required to produce a remedial plan for its failures. Its new commissioner, Mark Rowley, promised to be “ruthless” in rooting out wrongdoing. Dealing with the investigation into Mr Kaba’s death will be an early test.</p>
<h3>Pamuk muses on pandemics and politics</h3>
<p class="customisedFont">Orhan Pamuk, Turkey’s most famous writer, had already spent a few years working on his new novel, a story set against the backdrop of a bubonic plague outbreak in the Ottoman empire in the early 1900s, when the covid pandemic struck. The prolonged lockdowns and concerns about his own health inspired copious rewrites. The resulting book, “<a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/05/01/turkeys-best-known-author-reflects-on-politics-and-pestilence">Nights of Plague</a>”, which came out in Turkish last year, is released in America on Tuesday. </p>
<p class="customisedFont">The novel centres on a murder mystery on a fictional Ottoman island inhabited by both Turks and Greeks, but also muses about the power of modern states. Some of Mr Pamuk’s characters are familiar: Abdulhamid II, a sultan who struggles to save the Ottoman empire, shares autocratic and Islamist tendencies with Turkey’s president, <a class="mdui-text-color-red-a700" href="https://economist.com/europe/2022/06/09/as-elections-approach-turkeys-president-finds-enemies-everywhere">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>. Another resembles the country’s founder, Kemal Ataturk. For a historical novel, “Nights of Plague” can feel quite contemporary.</p>
